Here is a list of the best newsletters for web developers in 2020.

By best I mean _my favorite_.

Of the many great newsletters available for web developers, these are the 10 that I find give me a well-rounded perspective on current trends and must-know developments in our field with minimal redundancy and maximal entertainment value.

This post is an update from my [Best Newsletters for Web Developers in 2019](http://jarednielsen.com/2019-best-newsletters-web-developers/). The changes? I removed [Pony Foo](https://ponyfoo.com/weekly). They took a month-long hiatus in November. While it is still one of the _best_ newsletters out there, I’m reluctant to recommend it it’s delivery won’t be consistent in 2020. I also removed [Python Weekly](https://www.pythonweekly.com/), not because it isn’t a great newsletter, but to make room for newsletters that are either more specific to web development. 


## Best Newsletters for Web Developers in 2020

### Hacker Newsletter

If you subscribe to only one newsletter, this is it. It’s all here.

📨 [Hacker Newsletter](https://hackernewsletter.com/)


### TL;DR

_TL;DR_ is a daily dose of tech news curated for web developers. There are of course links to the big stories but also interesting GitHub repos and projects.

### JavaScript Weekly

In addition to updates on the rapidly evolving JavaScript ecosystem, this newsletter is loaded with tutorials for every skill level as well as links to new and interesting projects. And if you want to really nerd out, you can sign up for its sister publications, [Node Weekly](https://nodeweekly.com/) and [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com/), but note that the most important stories bubble up to _JavaScript Weekly_.

### Mozilla Developer Newsletter

Mozilla is killing it lately. The latest Firefox is a big win for both consumers and developers with emphasis on privacy and the new CSS developer tools, respectively. Their newsletter also gets better with each iteration, too.

### Daily Developer Tips

If you came of age in the era of jQuery or are just beginning to learn JavaScript, this is an excellent newsletter for leveling up on “vanilla JS” with practical, real-world scenarios. Chris Ferdinandi also addresses ethical questions that we as developers need to consider. FYI: This newsletter is primarily promotional.

### Pointer

_Pointer_ tends to address concerns related to management, both inter- and intra- personal. There is something perspective-changing in every issue, no matter where you are in your career trajectory as a web developer.

### History of the Web

There is no urgency in reading this newsletter as it is all old news, but it is definitely in the need-to-know category. Each issue is a deep-dive into a ‘forgotten’ history of the web. The issues are always fascinating and always informative.

### Programming Digest

This understated missive is excellent in its lean curation of high-level, language-agnostic articles on its stated topic. I look forward to its arrival every Sunday morning.

### Morning Cup of Coding

_Morning Cup of Coding_ is a very well-curated, terse list of articles. Most of the topics are _not_ specific to web development. What separates it from the other newsletters on this list is an emphasis on quality writing. Each edition highlights three or four articles on computer science topics that are _human-_readable. If you’re in the States, you’ll receive this in the afternoon. Timezones bedevil newsletter curators, too!

### Weekend Reads

Last but not least, the newsletter that equips me with memes for Monday. It’s a humorous mix of tweets, videos and GIFs (mostly) related to web development. Educational _and_ entertaining!
