Keeping up with the changing pace of technology is part and parcel of being a web developer. Listening to podcasts is a great way to stay informed and give your eyes a break. Unless you are independently wealthy or a short sleeper, there aren’t enough hours in the day to listen to all of them. Here are the best podcasts for web developers in 2020. By best I mean my favorite. 

## Criteria for Best Podcast

* **High-production value**: The audio is clear and equalized, and edited for 'easy listening'.
* **Focused**: The hosts don't spend _too_ much time chit-chatting, and get right to it, and are prepared with hard-hitting questions to keep an interview moving. 
* **Relevant**: The topics are timely.


## Best Podcasts for Web Developers in 2020

### Syntax.fm

If you only subscribe to one web development podcast, make it [_Syntax_](https://syntax.fm/). The production value is high, the pace is on point, and the hosts Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski, are charming. While it’s primarily focused on beginners, its coverage of emerging trends and technology will appeal to experienced developers, too. Scott and Wes use it as a platform to promote their courses, but they never sell too hard and their sponsorships are well-integrated into the show format.

🎙️ [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) 

🥇 Where to begin? [How to Get Better at Problem Solving](https://syntax.fm/show/198/how-to-get-better-at-problem-solving)

### Front-end Happy Hour

[_Front-end Happy Hour_](https://frontendhappyhour.com/) follows a ‘‘roundtable’ format, composed of working professionals at top-tier organizations, talking shop over drinks. It’s like hanging out at the bar with the coworkers you wish you had. Quality production, good pace, and the drinking game adds another layer to the discussion. As the name suggests, its focus is primarily front-end web development.

🎙️ [Front-end Happy Hour](https://frontendhappyhour.com/) 

🥇 Where to begin? [Tech lead engineer - herding cats & drinks](https://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/tech-lead-engineer-herding-cats-&-drinks/)

### IRL

Produced by [Mozillla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) and hosted by [Manoush Zomorodi](http://www.manoushz.com/), [_IRL_](https://irlpodcast.org/) covers the big picture topics you _need_ to be thinking about, but probably aren’t because you’re busy building the Internet. Each episode is a critical investigation of the effects of this thing we build on the people who use it _in real life_.

🎙️ [IRL](https://irlpodcast.org/)

🥇 Where to begin? [Democracy and the Internet](https://irlpodcast.org/season5/episode2/)

### FTFY

[_Fixed That For You_](https://fixedthatforyou.com/) claims to be a show about “solving problems with data and algorithms”, but that is seriously underselling it. Each episode is an exploration of the clever and ingenious solutions discovered to _fix_ extraordinary obstacles using the power of computation. It’s not specifically related to web development, but it’s fascinating and very well-produced. 

🎙️ [FTFY](https://fixedthatforyou.com/) 

🥇 Where to begin? [Data vs. Running While Blind](https://fixedthatforyou.com/episodes/data-vs-running-while-blind/)

### Chats with Kent

If I could be interviewed by anyone, my first choice would be Terry Gross. My second choice would be Kent C. Dodds. He _really_ listens to his guests. He’s modest, deferential, and honest about his knowledge gaps but smart AF. Kent quietly launched the first season of [_Chats with Kent_](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/) in August and quickly followed up with a second. Kent is a React developer, so much of the discussions are focused on that topic. But who isn’t, anymore? 

🎙️ [Chats with Kent](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/) 

🥇 Where to begin? [Growing Your Skills And Career Through Teaching - with Ali Spittel](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/seasons/01/episodes/growing-your-skills-and-career-through-teaching-with-ali-spittel)

### Function w/Anil Dash

Similar to _IRL_, [_Function_](https://glitch.com/culture/function/) explores the societal impact(s) of the products and services we produce. Unlike _IRL_, which is geared towards an audience of laypeople, and most likely due to the host, Anil Dash, being the CEO of [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), _Function_ gets into the nuts & bolts of _how_ this stuff works, not just _why_. 

🎙️ [Function](https://glitch.com/culture/function/) 

🥇 Where to begin? [American as Apple Pie: How Racism Gets Baked Into Technology](https://glitch.com/culture/function-episode-16/)

### Code[ish]

Did you know Heroku produces a podcast? They do, and it’s pretty good. The hosts of [_Code-ish_](https://www.heroku.com/podcasts/codeish) interview industry leaders and working professionals, so you get insight into the nuts and bolts of web development from a wide range of perspectives. But, because the hosts rotate episode to episode, quality is inconsistent and the interviews are sometimes rambling.

🎙️ [Code-ish](https://www.heroku.com/podcasts/codeish) 

🥇 Where to begin? [How to Prepare for Coding Interviews](https://www.heroku.com/podcasts/codeish/42-how-to-prepare-for-coding-interviews)

### The Vanilla JavaScript Podcast

Produced by Chris Ferdinandi, [_The Vanilla JavaScript Podcast_](https://vanillajspodcast.com/) is _vanilla_ in production, as well. Its stripped-down, straight-forward production is surprisingly refreshing in the golden age of podcasts. There are two primary types of episodes: philosophical and technical. In the ‘philosophical’ episodes, Chris muses about cultural and ethical concerns related to web development. In ‘technical’ episodes, Chris describes _code_ and pulls it off!

🎙️ [The Vanilla JavaScript Podcast](https://vanillajspodcast.com)

🥇 Where to begin? [Learning to code and gradual improvements](https://vanillajspodcast.com/learning-to-code-and-gradual-improvements/)

### Command_Line Heroes

Produced by RedHat and host Saron Yitbarek, [_Command Line Heroes_](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes) explores the recent history of computer science. This is all the stuff I _want_ to know, but can’t make myself sit down and read, so it’s great to get it in an engaing audio format. The production value is top-notch and each episode features interviews with luminaries in the field.

🎙️ [Command Lines Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes) 

🥇 Where to begin? [Creating JavaScript](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-3/creating-javascript)

### iteration

[_iteration_](https://iteration.simplecast.com/) is probably the most developer-specific podcast on this list. Each episode goes in-depth into _how_ as well as the _why_ a given technology exists and works. 

🎙️ [iteration](https://iteration.simplecast.com/)

🥇 Where to begin? [The Git Episode](https://iteration.simplecast.com/episodes/s08e02)


## Bonus

### Late Night Linux

Similar to _Front-End Happy Hour_, [_LNL_](https://latenightlinux.com/) is a ‘roundtable’ discussion of the news in Linux and open source technology. These are the sysadmins you wish you could hang out with. Yes, it’s Linux specific, but, if you’re a developer, why aren’t you using Linux yet?

🎙️ [Late Night Linux](https://latenightlinux.com/)

🥇 Where to begin? The most recent episode!


### Should This Exist?

Hosted by Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake, [_Should This Exist?_](https://shouldthisexist.com/) falls in the same category as _IRL_ and _Function_ in that it investigates the effects of technology on our lives. The twist? It looks at those technologies _before_ they reshape our lives.

🎙️ [Should This Exist?](https://shouldthisexist.com/)
