Here is a list of the best newsletters for web developers in 2021.

By best I mean _my favorite_.

Of the many great newsletters available for web developers, these are the 10 that I find give me a well-rounded perspective on current trends and must-know developments in our field with minimal redundancy and maximal entertainment value.

_Note: This post is an update from my [Best Newsletters for Web Developers in 2020](http://jarednielsen.com/2020-best-newsletters-web-developers/). The changes?

## Best Newsletters for Web Developers in 2021

### Hacker Newsletter

If you subscribe to only one newsletter, this is it. Itâ€™s all here.

ðŸ“¨ [Hacker Newsletter](https://hackernewsletter.com/)


### TL;DR

_TL;DR_ is a daily dose of tech news curated for web developers. There are of course links to the big stories but also interesting GitHub repos and projects.

### JavaScript Weekly

In addition to updates on the rapidly evolving JavaScript ecosystem, this newsletter is loaded with tutorials for every skill level as well as links to new and interesting projects. And if you want to really nerd out, you can sign up for its sister publications, [Node Weekly](https://nodeweekly.com/) and [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com/), but note that the most important stories bubble up to _JavaScript Weekly_.

### Weekly Mozilla News Beat

This week's internet news, from awesome to awful.

### Dev Tips

Umar's Dev Tips are a refreshing change of pace for your text-based inbox. Delivered daily, each tip is a screenshot GIF demonstrating useful web APIS, CSS tricks, and things you didn't know you could do with DevTools.

### Pointer

_Pointer_ tends to address concerns related to management, both inter- and intra- personal. There is something perspective-changing in every issue, no matter where you are in your career trajectory as a web developer.

### History of the Web

There is no urgency in reading this newsletter as it is all old news, but it is definitely in the need-to-know category. Each issue is a deep-dive into a â€˜forgottenâ€™ history of the web. The issues are always fascinating and always informative. It's also now a podcast and a series of CSS Tricks.

### Programming Digest

This understated missive is excellent in its lean curation of high-level, language-agnostic articles on its stated topic. I look forward to its arrival every Sunday morning.

### DEV Newsletter

Brought to you by Jess (from DEV), this newsletter rounds up the best community contributions on dev.to, plus links to new DevNews, DevDiscuss, and CodeNewbie podcasts. You'll need to create an account (Twitter or GitHub auth), and opt-in under Notifications in the Settings menu.

### Weekend Reads

Last but not least, the newsletter that equips me with memes for Monday. Itâ€™s a humorous mix of tweets, videos and GIFs (mostly) related to web development. Educational _and_ entertaining!
