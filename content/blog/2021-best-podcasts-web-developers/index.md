Keeping up with the changing pace of technology is part and parcel of being a web developer. Listening to podcasts is a great way to stay informed and give your eyes a break. Unless you are independently wealthy or a short sleeper, there aren’t enough hours in the day to listen to all of them. Here are the best podcasts for web developers in 2021. And by _best_ I mean my favorite. 

## Criteria for Best Podcast

* **High-production value**: The audio is clear and equalized, and edited for 'easy listening'.

* **Focused**: The hosts don't spend _too_ much time chit-chatting and get right to it, prepared with hard-hitting questions to keep an interview moving. 

* **Relevant**: The topics are timely.

## Best Podcasts for Web Developers in 2020

### Syntax.fm

If you only subscribe to one web development podcast, make it [_Syntax_](https://syntax.fm/). The production value is high, the pace is on point, and the hosts Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski, are charming. While it’s primarily focused on beginners, its coverage of emerging trends and technology will appeal to experienced developers, too. Scott and Wes use it as a platform to promote their courses, but they never sell too hard and their sponsorships are well-integrated into the show format.

### Command_Line Heroes

Produced by RedHat and host Saron Yitbarek, [_Command Line Heroes_](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes) explores the recent history of computer science. This is all the stuff I _want_ to know, but can’t make myself sit down and read, so it’s great to get it in an engaing audio format. The production value is top-notch and each episode features interviews with luminaries in the field.

🥇 Where to begin? [Jerry Lawson: The Engineer Who Changed the Game](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-6/jerry-lawson)


### Should This Exist?

If you miss _IRL_, check out [_Should This Exist?_](https://shouldthisexist.com/). Hosted by Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake it investigates the effects of technology on our lives. The twist? It looks at those technologies _before_ they reshape our lives.

🥇 Where to begin? [The Deepfake Detective](https://shouldthisexist.com/deepfake-detective/)


### Chats with Kent

If I could be interviewed by anyone, my first choice would be Terry Gross. My second choice would be Kent C. Dodds. He _really_ listens to his guests. He’s modest, deferential, and honest about his knowledge gaps but smart AF. Kent quietly launched the first season of [_Chats with Kent_](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/) in August and quickly followed up with a second. Kent is a React developer, so much of the discussions are focused on that topic. But who isn’t, anymore?

🥇 Where to begin? [Alex Anderson Creates Web-Based Spaceship Controls](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/seasons/03/episodes/alex-anderson-creates-web-based-spaceship-controls)


### iteration

[_iteration_](https://iteration.simplecast.com/) is probably the most developer-specific podcast on this list. Each episode goes in-depth into _how_ as well as the _why_ a given technology exists and works. 

🎙️ [iteration](https://iteration.simplecast.com/)

🥇 Where to begin? [The Soft Skills Episode](https://iteration.simplecast.com/episodes/the-soft-skills-episode)


### Ladybug

The [Ladybug](https://www.ladybug.dev/) podcast launched just over a year ago and in that time hosts Emma Bostian, Ali Spittel, Kelly Vaughn and now Sidney Buckner published 50+ episodes, covering a range of topics, from personal to professional development. 

🎙️ [Ladybug](https://www.ladybug.dev/)

🥇 Where to begin? [Web Accessibility](https://www.ladybug.dev/episodes/web-accessibilitiy)


### DEV Discuss

The team at [dev.to](https://dev.to) launched a podcast this year, aptly named [DEV Discuss](https://dev.to/devdiscuss/). The format of the show it two-fold: interviews with one or more guests on a theme followed by commentary from the DEV community. What? You're not part of the DEV community?

🥇 Where to begin? [Why Tech's Deadnaming Problem Matters](https://dev.to/devdiscuss/s1-e1-why-tech-s-deadnaming-problem-matters)


### Front-end Happy Hour

[_Front-end Happy Hour_](https://frontendhappyhour.com/) follows a ‘‘roundtable’ format, composed of working professionals at top-tier organizations, talking shop over drinks. It’s like hanging out at the bar with the coworkers you wish you had. Quality production, good pace, and the drinking game adds another layer to the discussion. As the name suggests, its focus is primarily front-end web development.

🥇 Where to begin? [Imposter Syndrome - Wine connoisseur with a $15 bottle](https://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/imposter-syndrome-wine-connoisseur-with-a-$15-bottle/)


### The Vanilla JavaScript Podcast

Produced by Chris Ferdinandi, [_The Vanilla JavaScript Podcast_](https://vanillajspodcast.com/) is _vanilla_ in production, as well. Its stripped-down, straight-forward production is surprisingly refreshing in the golden age of podcasts. There are two primary types of episodes: philosophical and technical. In the ‘philosophical’ episodes, Chris muses about cultural and ethical concerns related to web development. In ‘technical’ episodes, Chris describes _code_ and pulls it off!

🥇 Where to begin? [The challenges of being ethical in tech](https://vanillajspodcast.com/the-challenges-of-being-ethical-in-tech/)


### Late Night Linux

Similar to _Front-End Happy Hour_, [_LNL_](https://latenightlinux.com/) is a ‘roundtable’ discussion of the news in Linux and open source technology. These are the sysadmins you wish you could hang out with. Yes, it’s Linux specific, but, if you’re a developer, why aren’t you using Linux yet?
