TODO SOMETHING ABOUT BUBBLE SORT AND HOW IT IS AN COMPARISON / EXCHANGE ALGORITHM



If we are writing a sorting algorithm, we need to start with something to sort. Let’s declare an array of ‘unsorted’ integers:

```js
const unsorted = [10, 1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6, 5];
```

Next, let’s declare our insertionSort function:

```js
const bubbleSort = (arr) => {
    return arr;
};
```

Now what?

Let's revisit our problem solving heuristic: 

1. Understand the problem

2. Make a plan

3. Execute the plan

4. Evaluate the plan


### Understand the Problem

To understand our problem, we first need to define it.

Let's reframe the problem as acceptance criteria:

> GIVEN an array of unsorted numbers

> WHEN we compare the values of two adjacent numbers and find them out of ordinal sequence

> THEN we exchange their positions in the array
