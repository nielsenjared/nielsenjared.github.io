If you want to learn how to code, you need to learn algorithms. Learning algorithms improves your problem solving skills by revealing design patterns in programming. In this tutorial, you will learn how to generate combinations in JavaScript _and_ Python.

## Retrieval Practice

Retrieval practice is the surest way to solidify any new learning. Attempt to answer the following questions before proceeding:

* TODO 

* TODO

* What's a combination? 


### TODO #1

TODO


### TODO #2

TODO


### TODO #3

TODO


## Let's Get Meta

Ask yourself the following questions and keep them back of mind as you proceed:

* Why do I need to know this?

* What problem(s) does TODO solve? 

* TODO


## How to Code the TODO Algorithm 

[Programming is problem solving](https://jarednielsen.com/programming-problem-solving/). There are four steps we need to take to solve any programming problem: 

1. Understand the problem

2. Make a plan

3. Execute the plan

4. Evaluate the plan


### Understand the Problem

To understand our problem, we first need to define it. Let’s reframe the problem as acceptance criteria:

```md
GIVEN a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`
WHEN I specify the size of each set of combinations, `k`
THEN I am returned all possible combinations of the values from 1 to `n` in sets of size `k`
```

That’s our general outline. We know our input conditions, TODO, and our output requirements, TODO, and our goal is to TODO.

Let’s make a plan!


### Make a Plan

Let’s revisit our computational thinking heuristics as they will aid and guide is in making a plan. They are: 

* Decomposition

* Pattern recognition

* Abstraction

* Algorithm design

The first step is decomposition, or breaking our problem down into smaller problems. What's the smallest problem we can solve? 

We need to write an algorithm with two inputs, `n` and `k`. 

If `n` is equal to 1, then the only combination is `[1]`.

If `n` is equal to 2, and `k` is equal to 1, then our combinations are `[1], [2]`.

If `n` is equal to 2, and `k` is equal to 2, then our only combination is `[1, 2]`.

If `n` is equal to 3, and `k` is equal to 2, it starts to get interesting. Our combinations are `[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]`.

### Execute the Plan

Now it's simply a matter of translating our pseudocode into the syntax of our programming language. Let's start with JavaScript...

Now let's see it in Python...


#### How to Code the TODO Algorithm in Python

```

### Evaluate the Plan

Can we do better?

## Reflection

Remember those _meta_ questions we asked at the outset? Let’s make it stick and answer them now!

* Why do I need to know this?

* What problem(s) does TODO solve?
