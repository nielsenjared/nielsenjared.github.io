## How to Code the Fizz Buzz Algorithm in JavaScript 

[Programming is problem solving](https://jarednielsen.com/programming-problem-solving/). There are four steps we need to take to solve any programming problem: 

1. Understand the problem

2. Make a plan

3. Execute the plan

4. Evaluate the plan


### Understand the Problem

To understand our problem, we first need to define it. Let’s reframe the problem as acceptance criteria:

> GIVEN
> WHEN
> THEN 

That’s our general outline. We know our input conditions ( TODO ) and our output requirements ( TODO ), and our goal is to organize the elements in the array in ascending, or non-descending, order.

Let’s make a plan!


### Make a Plan

Let’s revisit our computational thinking heuristics as they will aid and guide is in making a plan. They are: 

* Decomposition

* Pattern recognition

* Abstraction

* Algorithm

TODO


### Execute the Plan

```js
TODO
```



### Evaluate the Plan

TODO



```js

```

None! But learning how to implement it in more than one way builds your street cred.
