If you want to learn how to code, you need to learn algorithms. Learning algorithms improves your problem solving skills by revealing design patterns in programming. In this tutorial, you will learn how to code the bubble sort algorithm in JavaScript.

## How to Code the {{ TODO TITLE }} Algorithm in JavaScript 

[Programming is problem solving](https://jarednielsen.com/programming-problem-solving/). There are four steps we need to take to solve any programming problem: 

1. Understand the problem

2. Make a plan

3. Execute the plan

4. Evaluate the plan


### Understand the Problem

To understand our problem, we first need to define it. Let’s reframe the problem as acceptance criteria:

> GIVEN
> WHEN
> THEN 

That’s our general outline. We know our input conditions (an unsorted array) and our output requirements (a sorted array), and our goal is to organize the elements in the array in ascending, or non-descending, order.

Let’s make a plan!

### Make a Plan

Let’s revisit our computational thinking heuristics as they will aid and guide is in making a plan. They are: 

* Decomposition

* Pattern recognition

* Abstraction

* Algorithm

### Execute the Plan

```js
