If you want to think like a programmer, you need to learn algorithms. Learning algorithms improves your problem solving skills by revealing common patterns in software development. The following is a table of contents of my articles on algorithms. If you think thereâ€™s something missing, let me know on Twitter [@jarednielsen](https://twitter.com/jarednielsen). And thereâ€™s more on the way!
