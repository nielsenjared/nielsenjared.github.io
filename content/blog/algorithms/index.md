TODO INTRODUCTION
something about computational thinking 

With heuristics! 

I had you at heuristics, didn't I?

Like your health or your retirement, there's no shortcut to learning how to solve algorithms. 

Do the work. 

Practice makes practice. 


Lucky for us, there's an old school approach to problem solving that is still relevant today. 


## How To Solve It

In [How to Solve It](TODO), George Polya outlines four steps of problem solving: 

1. Understand the problem.

2. Make a plan.

3. Execute the plan. 

4. Evaluate the result.


### Understand the Problem

TODO 

Many alogirthms are disguised as story problems, such as the farmer who needs to get his goose, his corn, and his fox across the river. But! He can only carry one of these at a time. If left alone, the goose will eat the corn and the fox will eat the goose. How does he do it? 

Reframe the problem as a user story. 

I know. 

They're awkward. 

They _feel_ like work, don't they?

But the thing is, they _work_! 

The format for a user story is: 

AS A < USER OF SOME SORT >
I WANT < THIS FEATURE >
SO THAT < MY EXISTENCE IS VALIDATED >

Reframing a problem as a user story then makes it very easy to write acceptance criteria. 

The format for acceptance criteria is: 

GIVEN < APPLICATION >
WHEN < I DO THIS >
THEN < I EXPECT THE APP TO DO THAT >


### Make a Plan

AKA Pseudocode. 

You write pseudocode, don't you? 

Writing pseudocode is like making a sketch for a design. 

It's your back-of-the-envelope proof-of-concept. 

It's your discovery phase, your user research, your market validation. 

It's your roadmap. 

It's also the comments for your function. 

Just // each line and there you go. 


### Execute the Plan

It's show time. 

After all this problem understanding and plan making, it's time to crack your fingers, dust off the keyboard, and code code code! 

This part will be easy because why? 

Because you wrote a solution in pseudocode. All you need to do now is translate that plain language into JavaScript, Python, or Java (shudder).

You got this! 


### Evaluate the Plan

Now run that code! 

Did it work? 

If not, why? 

Back to step 1. 

Repeat until all tests pass. 


## TODO How to Solve It with Computational Thinking 

The steps above are table stakes. 

If you want to turn pro, you need to assimilate with the Borg. 

You need to learn how to think like a computer. 

There are four primary part of computational thinking: 

* Decomposition

* Pattern recognition, or generalisation

* Abstraction 

* Algorithms 


### Decomposition

### Generalisation

### TODO Algorithms OR Evaluation?
