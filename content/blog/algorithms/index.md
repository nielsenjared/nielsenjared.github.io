TODO INTRODUCTION
something about computational thinking 

With heuristics! 

I had you at heuristics, didn't I?

Like your health or your retirement, there's no shortcut to learning how to solve algorithms. 

Do the work. 

Practice makes practice. 


Lucky for us, there's an old school approach to problem solving that is still relevant today. It's called, you'll never guess...

_How to Solve It_.


## How To Solve It

In [How to Solve It](TODO), George Polya outlines four steps of problem solving: 

1. Understand the problem.

2. Make a plan.

3. Execute the plan. 

4. Evaluate the result.


### Understand the Problem

TODO 

Many alogirthms are disguised as story problems, such as the farmer who needs to get his goose, his corn, and his fox across the river. But! He can only carry one of these at a time. If left alone, the goose will eat the corn and the fox will eat the goose. How does he get everything across?

Story time.

User story time, that is.

I know. 

They're awkward. 

They _feel_ like work, don't they?

But the thing is, they _work_! 

The format for a user story is: 

AS A < USER OF SOME SORT >
I WANT < TO DO THIS >
SO THAT < MY EXISTENCE IS VALIDATED >

In our farmer example above: 

AS A farmer
I WANT to ferry my goose, fox, and corn across the river
SO THAT we all live happily ever after

Reframing a problem as a user story then makes it very easy to write acceptance criteria. 

The format for acceptance criteria is: 

GIVEN < APPLICATION >
WHEN < I DO THIS >
THEN < I EXPECT THE APP TO DO THAT >

In our farmer example above: 

GIVE three items that each other
WHEN I ferry one item across the river
THEN the other two are safe


### Make a Plan

The next step in Polya's heuristic is to make a plan.

AKA pseudocode. 

You write pseudocode, don't you? 

Writing pseudocode is like making a sketch for a design. 

It's your back-of-the-envelope proof-of-concept. 

It's your discovery phase, your user research, your market validation. 

It's your roadmap. 

It's also the comments for your function. 

Just // each line and there you go. 


### Execute the Plan

It's show time. 

After all this problem understanding and plan making, it's time to crack your fingers, dust off the keyboard, and code code code! 

This part will be easy because why? 

Because you wrote pseudocode! All you need to do now is translate that plain language into JavaScript, Python, or (shudder) Java.

You got this! 


### Evaluate the Plan

Now run that code! 

Did it work? 

If no, back to step 1. 

If yes, can you do better? 


## TODO How to Solve It with Computational Thinking 

The steps above are table stakes. 

If you want to turn pro, you need to assimilate with the Borg and learn how to think like a computer. 

There are four primary part of computational thinking: 

* Decomposition

* Pattern recognition, or generalisation

* Abstraction 

* Algorithms 


### Decomposition

If composing a function is the process of assembling the various components, such as variable, control flow, and conditions, then decomposition is the opposite: it's breaking a problem down into smaller parts.

TODO
This is the easiest _and_ the hardest step in the process because sometimes the component parts of a problem are obvious, but other times the component parts are emergent, or intertwined, and it's difficult to cleanly separate them. 

TODO

### Generalisation

TODO 
We look for a pattern. 

Do we see a pattern in our farmer story? 

Yes!

TODO
Our farmer needs to cross the river several times to get everything across. 




### Abstraction 

TODO 
We remove the details. 

What if it wasn't a farmer? What if it was a lawyer? With three clients who would eat each other and they needed to get across town to the courthouse. 

Or what if it was TODO 

Or what if we don't know who it is, but we know they've got three problems in tow? 

We abstract away the details. 

Rather than a farmer, it's 


### Algorithm

TODO 

Now we need to write a series of steps to solve our problem. 








## How to Solve Any Algorithm

You can solve any algorithm using Polya's heuristic and computational thinking

The farmer story problem is just a swap.
