## What Problem(s) Does Big O Notation Solve?

* Big O notation helps us answer the question, ‚ÄúWill it scale?‚Äù 

* Big O notation equips us with a shared language for discussing performance with other developers (and mathematicians!).


## Quick Refreshers

If you're just joining us, you will want to start with the first article in this series, [What is Big O Notation?](https://jarednielsen.com/big-o-notation/)

### What is Big O Notation? 

Big O is a notation for measuring the performance of an algorithm. Big O notation mathematically describes the complexity of an algorithm in terms of time and space. We don‚Äôt measure the _speed_ of an algorithm in seconds (or minutes!). We measure the _rate of growth_ of an algorithm in the number of operations it takes to complete. 

The O is short for ‚ÄúOrder of magnitude‚Äù. So, if we‚Äôre discussing an algorithm with _O(n)_, we say its order of magnitude, or rate of growth, is _n_, or linear complexity. 


### How Does Big O Notation Work? 

Big O notation measures the _worst-case runtime_. 

Why?

Because we don‚Äôt know what we don‚Äôt know.

If we‚Äôre writing a search algorithm, we won‚Äôt always know the query ahead of time. If we‚Äôre writing a sorting algorithm, we won‚Äôt always know the dataset ahead of time. We want to know just how poorly our algorithm will perform so we can plan accordingly. 

The worst-case scenario is also known as the ‚Äúupper bound‚Äù. 

Remember this table? 

| O             | Run time          |       |
|---            |---                |---    |
| O(1)          | constant          | fast  |
| O(log n)      | logarithmic       |       |
| O(n)          | linear            |       |
| O(n * log n)  | log linear        |       |   
| O(n^2)        | quadratic         |       |
| O(n^3)        | cubic             |       |
| O(2^n)        | exponential       |       |
| O(n!)         | factorial         | slow  |

It lists common runtimes from fastest to slowest. 

We learned O(1), or constant time complexity, in [What is Big O Notation?](https://jarednielsen.com/big-o-notation/). We're going to skip O(log n) for the time being. It will be easier to understand after learning O(n), linear time complexity, and O(n^2), quadratic time complexity. 

Before getting into O(n), let‚Äôs begin with a quick refreshser on O(1), constant time complexity.

### O(1): Constant Time Complexity 

Constant time compelxity, or O(1), is just that: constant. Regardless of the size of the input, the algorithm only needs to perform one operation to return an output.

Here‚Äôs an example we used in the previous tutorial: 

```js
const isEven = num => num % 2 === 0;
```

Our algorithm checks whether or not a number is even or odd and will return true or false accordingly. It only needs to perform one operation regardless of the size of the number. 

Say you‚Äôre working with an API that returns a users full name in an array, like so: 

```js
[‚ÄúJared‚Äù, ‚ÄúNielsen‚Äù];
```

Your task is to get the users first name. Easy, in JavaScript:

```js
const getFirstName = data => data[0];
```

No matter how many times you run your ‚Äòalgorithm‚Äô, it only needs to perform one operation to return the desired value. That‚Äôs O(1), or constant time.

One more example: 

```js
const grader = score => {
   if (score < 60) {
       return "Fail!";
   } else if (num > 60) {
       return "Pass!";
   } else {
       return "Living on the edge?";
   };
}
```

What is our _best-case scenario_ for this algorithm? 

If `score` is less than 60, we will only perform one operation and return. 

That would be O(1). 

What if `score` is greater than or equal to 60? 

It's still O(1).

Why? 

Even though we check multiple conditions before returning, the order of magnitude, or rate of growth, is _constant_. The size of the input does not affect the number of operations performed. We know the _upper bound_, or worst-case scenario, in advance, and we know it will not change. 


## O(n): Linear Time Complexity

If O(1) performs only one computation regardless of the size of the input, what is O(n)?

For _n_ inputs, our algorithm will perform _n_ outputs. This is linear time complexity. 

Why? 

If we were to chart this on a graph, what would it look like? 

A straight line.


### Math O'Clock üßÆ üïù 

Remember [linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation) from algebra? 

```
y = mx + b
```

This is the slope intercept form, where _m_ is the [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope), or direction and steepness of the line, and _b_ is the [y-intercept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-intercept), or the point at which the line crosses the vertical axis. In this example, _x_ is the variable, unknown value that we want to 'solve for' (the 'solution' being _y_) and _m_ and _b_ are [coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient), or parameters, that will influence _x_.

Let's plug in some values.

```
y = 2x + 1
```

If we chart this, the result will be: 

![](./jarednielsen-big-o-linear-chart-2x+1.png)
If we change our coefficients: 

```
y = 1/2x - 1
```

And chart the equation:  

![](./jarednielsen-big-o-linear-chart-1-2x-1.png)

What if we drop our coefficients entirely and simply chart _x_?

![](./jarednielsen-big-o-linear-chart-x.png)

Still a straight line. 

What if charted `1`?

![](./jarednielsen-big-o-linear-chart-1.png)

Also still a straight line.

But!

Because the value is _constant_, not variable, our line does not represent a rate of change, or growth, over time.

Speaking of time, math o'clock is over. Back to Big O.

### Drop the Constant Terms

What if we calculated our operations for an algorithm and, rather than just `n`, it was actually something like: 

```
2n + 1
```

Would we then write O(2n + 1)?

No. 

That‚Äôs still just O(n). 

Why?

With Big O, we drop the constants and the non-dominant terms. They don‚Äôt provide any meaningful additional information. O(n) and O(2n +1) are both linear. As we saw above, if you chart `2n + 1`, it would still be a straight line. That‚Äôs what we really want to know. Multiplying by a constant value, in this example, `2`, influences the rate of growth of our algorithm by a constant amount. With or without it, the algorithm is still linear. 


### Worst-Case Scenario

But what if our algorithm, say a search function, returns its parameter after one operation? Would that be O(1)? 

No. It‚Äôs still O(n). 

Why? 

Remember, with Big O, we measure the _worst case scenario_. Because we don‚Äôt know what we don‚Äôt know, our default assumption for any algorithm is its worst-case scenario. In a worst case scenario, an O(n) algorithm needs to perform its specified operation on every value in the input. When making our Big O calculation, we want to know just how poorly an algorithm is going to perform. 

Say, for example, we have an array of animals: 

```js
const animals = [‚Äúocelot‚Äù, ‚Äúoctopus‚Äù, ‚Äúopossum‚Äù, ‚Äúorangutan‚Äù, ‚Äúorca‚Äù, ‚Äúoriole‚Äù, ‚Äúoryx‚Äù, ‚Äúosprey‚Äù];
```

And let‚Äôs say our task is to find the location of a specific animal in the array based on user input:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
    if (animals[i] === userInput) {
        return `Found ${userInput} at ${i}`;
    };
};
```

If our user searches for ‚Äúocelot‚Äù, how many computations are performed? 

One. It‚Äôs the first item in our array, so our program will return after one operation. 

But, if our user searches for ‚Äúosprey‚Äù, how many computations are performed? 

Eight. That‚Äôs our worst case scenario. For eight inputs, our algorithm will perform eight operations.

What if our array contained 100 animals? 

The worst-case scenario would be 100 operations. 

What about 1,000?

10,000?

100,000?

1,000,000?

All O(n).

You can see how linear complexity is fine for small datasets, but becomes a concern when the size of the input increases. 


### Drop Non-Dominant Terms 

What's the order of magnitude of this function? 

```js
const lowerList = arr => {
    if (arr.length === 0) {
        return "Nothing to be done";
    } else {
        return arr.map(i => i.toLowerCase());
    }
}
```

If our condition is met, it will perform one operation, so it's constant, or O(1).

If our condition is not met, then we map our array and return it. The length of that array is unknown, but for every element in the array, we perform an operation, so it's linear, or O(n).

That means our function is (1 + n). 

Which of these is the worst-case scenario, or upper bound? 

_n_

This is considered our dominant term. We can drop `1`, and our algorithm is simply O(n).

What would the worst-case scenario of O(n^2 + n) be?

We'll find out in the next tutorial.
