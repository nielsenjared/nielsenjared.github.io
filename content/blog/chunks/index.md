How do you eat an elephant? 

You don’t. 

You first become a vegan.

Then you donate to the WWF. 

Lastly, you get online and start a flamewar with anyone who uses this archaic idiom.

You can find me on Twitter @jarednielsen

See what I did there? 

If you want to master a new skill or solve a mammoth problem, break it into bite-, or byte-, sized pieces. 

“One of the first steps toward gaining expertise in math and science is to create conceptual chunks--mental leaps that unite separate bits of information through meaning.”

In A Mind for Numbers, Barbara Oakley outlines three steps for learning by chunking:

1. Focus

2. Understand

3. Contextualize

You can’t truly learn something if you are distracted, trying to learn too many things at once, or trying to eat an elephant. Continually break the problem down until the pieces are digestible and proceed one-at-a-time.

Chunks are useless if you don’t know what they mean. How does this chunk work? Why?

Lastly, put the pieces back together. How does what you are chunking fit into the big picture? How does it relate to other chunks? 

"Chunking may involve your learning how to use a certain problem-solving technique. Context means learning when to use that technique instead of some other technique."


When learning something new, we want to create chunks.

What is a chunk? 

"One of the first steps toward gaining expertise in math and science is to create conceptual chunks--mental leaps that unite separate bits of information through meaning."

With chunking, we learn a concept then combine that concept with other concepts to solve problems. If we encounter a concept that is too big to understand, we need to break it into smaller chunks, then recombine the chunks. 

We divide & conquer! 

This is also a common pattern in algorithm design. 

Divide & conquer recursively breaks a problem down into smaller and smaller pieces. 

These smaller pieces are then recombined into a solution to the problem. 

What’s the pattern?

    Divide
    Conquer
    Combine

What are the chunks you need to know to implement a divide and conquer algorithm?

    Basic maths (division and inequality)
    Conditional statements and operators
    Iteration
    Recursion

We could break it down even further.

    Variables
    Data types
    Array methods
    Indexes
    Functions
    Control flow
    Etc.

These are a few of the programming fundamentals, or chunks, in our library that enable us to create more complex chunks, such as recursion. 

In A Mind for Numbers, Barbara Oakley writes:

In building a chunked library, you are training your brain to recognize not only a specific problem, but different types and classes of problems so that you can automatically know how to quickly solve whatever you encounter. You’ll start to see patterns that simplify problem solving for you and will soon find that different solution techniques are lurking at the edge of your memory.
