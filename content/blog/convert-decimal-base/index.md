@TODO introduction




A classic problem solved using the stack data structure is base conversion. To understand how to convert decimal to base, it's useful to first understand how to convert decimal to binary. 


## Reflection Practice

* What's a stack? 

* What's a base? 

* What is binary?


### What's a Stack? 

A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out principle (LIFO). We can only add or remove elements from the top of the stack .

If you want to go deeper, read [JavaScript Stack Data Structure](https://jarednielsen.com/data-structure-stack-javascript/).


### What's a Base? 

A base is the number of different digits used to count in a numerical system. We count in base 10 most likely due to us evolving ten fingers. When we count in base 10, we use ten distinct _whole_ numbers.  


### What is Binary?

Binary is base 2. We have two different digits to count with, `0` and `1`. (Or `true` and `false`). 

Counting from 1 to 10 with our hands is easy. Our fingers are like switches and we flip them. 

What do we do when we go beyond 10? 

We flip those switches the other way! 

We not only extend or retract our fingers to count to ten, if we are counting a value greater than ten, we also track the number of times we count by 10. 

```
0 
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

What happens when we reach 9? 

We _overflow_ into another digit on the left and reset the digit on the right, giving us `10`. We then increment the right-most digit as we count up:
```
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
```

What happens when we reach 19? 

We increment the value of the digit on the left by `1`. 

This may seem rudimentary, but bear with me.

What happens when we reach 99? 

We need to _overflow_ again and add another digit, giving us `100`.

If we knew at the outset that we wanted to count beyond `100`, we could start with three digits and proceed like this:
```
000
001
002
...
009
010
011
...
099
100
101
```
etc.

What if we are limited to two fingers, or switches? 

We're going to need a lot more digits!

## How to Convert Decimal to Binary 

Our challenge is to convert a decimal, such as `10`, to its binary counterpart, `1010`. 

How do we break this problem down? 

In base 10, what is `1`? 

It is one of ten possible values, or, `1 / 10`. 

What does that look like? 

What mathematical operation do we use to break problems down? 

Division. 

So in base 2, what is `1`? 

It is one of _two_ possible values. 

So if we're using division to convert to binary, what is our divisor? 

`2`

What does the operation of division return? 

A quotient and a remainder. 

Let's start simple and convert `0` to binary. What is the quotient of the following: 
```
0 / 2
```

ðŸ™„

It's `0`.

What's the remainder of `0 / 2`? Also `0`. 

If we start to build a table, it looks like this so far:

| Decimal   | Binary  |
| ---       | ---     |
| 0         | 0       |

Because we are only working with two values, `0` and `1`, we can surmise that the decimal `1` converted to binary is also `1`. 

But don't take my word for it! Let's proove it . What is `1 / 2`?
```
1 / 2 = 0.5
```

Not exactly a _whole_ number!

But the remainder _is_ 1. How? 

We use the [division algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm), which states that:

> for integers `N` and `D` where `D != 0`, there are unique integers `Q` and `R` where `0 <= R < abs(D)`

In other words: 
```
N = D * Q + R
```

Where `N` is our dividend, `D` is our divisor, and `Q` and `R` are the quotient and remainder, respectively.

ðŸ‘† Keep in mind that `Q` is not the quotient we return from the division operation of `1 / 2`. It's the number of times the divisor goes into the dividend, which is `0`. 

So, using our equation above:
```
1 = 2 * 0 + 1
```

We add this value to our table:
| Decimal   | Binary  |
| ---       | ---     |
| 0         | 0       |
| 1         | 1       |
| 2         | ?       |

What about `2`?
```
2 / 2
```

The quotient is `1` and the remainder is `0`. But we already have `1` and `0` in our table? 

We need to _overflow_, meaning we now need _at least_ two digits to represent anything greater than decimal `2`. 

What happens when we overflow? 

We increment the value to the left and reset the value on the right, so when we add `2` to our table: 
| Decimal   | Binary  |
| ---       | ---     |
| 0         | 0       |
| 1         | 1       |
| 2         | 10      |

Are you starting to see the pattern? 

We're building our binary strings with the remainder, and not the quotient, of our division operation. 

```
2 / 2 = 1
1 / 2 = 0
```

So the binary conversion of `2` is `10`. 

What's 3? 
```
3 / 2 = 1
1 / 2 = 1
```
| Decimal   | Binary  |
| ---       | ---     |
| 0         | 0       |
| 1         | 1       |
| 2         | 10      |
| 3         | 11      |

What about `4`? 

You guessed it, we need to _overflow_.
| Decimal   | Binary  |
| ---       | ---     |
| 0         | 0       |
| 1         | 1       |
| 2         | 10      |
| 3         | 11      |
| 4         | 100     |

What about `5`? Now its' getting interesting. Our plan is to use a Stack data structure to in our algorithm solution. Using the LIFO principle, imagine _pushing_ values to the binary string as we build it. 

```
5 / 2 = 2
5 % 2 = 1
```

We _push_ the remainder to a string: 
```
1
```

We now divide our quotient, `2`, by `2`.
```
2 / 2 = 1
2 % 2 = 0
```

We _push_ the remainder to our string: 
```
01
```

We're not at zero, yet. Our quotient is `1`, so we divide that by 2.
```
1 / 2 < 0
1 % 2 = 1
```

Our remainder is again `1`, so we _push_ that to our string:
```
101
```

There's our binary conversion of the decimal 5:
| Decimal   | Binary  |
| ---       | ---     |
| 0         | 0       |
| 1         | 1       |
| 2         | 10      |
| 3         | 11      |
| 4         | 100     |
| 5         | 100     |


Let's translate this to JavaScript using a Stack: 

```js
const decimalToBinary = (num) => {
  const stack = new Stack();

  let mod;
  let result = '';
  
  while (num > 0){ 
    mod = Math.floor(num % 2); 
    stack.push(mod); 
    num = Math.floor(num / 2); 
  }
  
  while (stack.top > 0){ 
    result += stack.pop();
  }

  return result;
}
```
@TODO what's happening here? 


## How to Convert Decimal to Base

Let's take our algorithm above and extend it to convert any base between binary and hexadecimal. To do that, though, we need to answer the question posed above: how do we count using a base greater than 10? 

```js
const decimalToBase = (num, base) => {
  const stack = new Stack();

  const digits = '0123456789ABCDEF';
  let mod;
  let result = '';
  
  while (num > 0) {
    mod = Math.floor(num % base);
    stack.push(mod);
    num = Math.floor(num / base);
  }
  
  while (stack.top > 0) {
    result += digits[stack.pop()];
  }

  return result;
}
```

What's happening here? 

To calculate a base, we need to divide the decimal by the desired base until the quotient is zero. We store the remainder of each division operation and use that to create a string representing the base. 

We first declare a new instance of our `Stack` class, `stack`. 

We next declare `mod`, `result`, and `digits`. We'll see how each of these are used as we proceed. 

We iterate using a `while` loop. 

1. We get the remainder of our num _modulo_ base and assign it to `mod`. We then push `mod` onto the stack.
