## What is a Graph? 

A graph consists of a set of nodes, or _vertices_, connected by _edges_.  An edge consists of a pair of _vertices_. For example, given two vertices, `A` and `B`, when traversing a graph, the path between `A` and `B` is an edge. 

`A` and `B` are _adjacent_. 

### Degrees

The number of adjacent vertices. 




Weight? 

The classic analogy for graphs is a map. 
@TODO

Another standard analogy for graphs is a social network. 



### Two Types of Graph

* directed, or digraph

A graph with ordered pairs is a directed graph, or digraph. 


* undirected, or just graph

### Paths & Cycles

@TODO 
+ strongly connected

## How to Implement a Graph Data Structure in JavaScript

Like a social network, what is important is the relationship between nodes and not the nodes themselves. 

Graphs differ from trees in that trees always follow the same structure. The relationships between nodes are predetermined: root and children. We don't know what the structure of our graph will look like in advance, so when we implement a graph class, tracking the relationship between vertices is more important than the vertices themselves. 



@TODO why is it inefficient to use objects in a graph?
