At some point in your career (today?!) you will want to learn data structures. It's not _just_ to ace the technical interview and land your dream job. Learning data structures will help you understand how software works and improve your problem-solving skills. In this tutorial, you will learn the {{ ToDO }} in JavaScript. 


If you're new to data structures, you may want to start with [Data Structures in JavaScript: Array](https://jarednielsen.com/data-structure-array-javascript/)


## Retrieval Practice

Retrieval practice is the surest way to solidify any new learning. Attempt to answer the following questions before proceeding:

## Let's Get Meta

Programming is problem solving. Both are metacognitive activities. To excel, we want to improve our thinking _about_ thinking. Ask yourself the following questions and keep them back of mind as you proceed: 
 
* What is hashing?

* What is a hash table?

* What problems does a hash tables solve?






### What is hashing? 

storing and retrieving data very quickly

## How to {{ }}/ HashTable in JavaScript

This is the final data structure in our series. All of the previous data structures solve different problems , but what is the downside to most of them? 

Iteration.

When we are searching for a node, we need to iterate over the entire data structure. This is not very efficient. 



TODO 

```js 
const hashTable = {};
```

Done. 

ðŸ™„

Seriously.

For our intents and purposes, an objcet _is_ a hash table. When we insert a new value into an objcet, a key is made


But that's not why you're here. Let's do this the hard way.




```JavaScript


```
Why an array?

Why would we not use an object?
