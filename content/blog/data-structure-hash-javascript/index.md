At some point in your career (today?!) you will want to learn data structures. It's not _just_ to ace the technical interview and land your dream job. Learning data structures will help you understand how software works and improve your problem-solving skills. In this tutorial, you will learn the {{ ToDO }} in JavaScript. 


If you're new to data structures, you may want to start with [Data Structures in JavaScript: Array](https://jarednielsen.com/data-structure-array-javascript/)


## Retrieval Practice

Retrieval practice is the surest way to solidify any new learning. Attempt to answer the following questions before proceeding:

## Let's Get Meta

Programming is problem solving. Both are metacognitive activities. To excel, we want to improve our thinking _about_ thinking. Ask yourself the following questions and keep them back of mind as you proceed: 
 
* What is hashing?

* What is a hash table?

* What problems does a hash tables solve?

## How to {{ }} HashTable in JavaScript

This is the final data structure in our series. All of the previous data structures solve different problems, but what is the downside to most of them? 

ðŸ•¥

Iteration.

When we are searching for a node, we need to iterate over the entire data structure. This is not very efficient. 

TODO 

```js 
const hashTable = {};
```

Done. 

ðŸ™„

Seriously.

For our intents and purposes, an object _is_ a hash table. When we insert a new value into an object, a key is made

But that's not why you're here. Let's do this the hard way.

Let's start with an array of programming languages:
```js

```


```JavaScript


```
Why an array?

Why would we not use an object?


### Hashing 





## Reflection

* What is hashing?

* What is a hash table?

* What problems does a hash tables solve?


### What is Hashing?

There are two common wasys to think about hashing: 

* finding a value in a data structure as quickly as possible

* creating a key to use when looking up a vbalue in a hash table
