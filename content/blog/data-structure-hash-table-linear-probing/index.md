At some point in your career (today?!) you will want to learn data structures. It's not _just_ to ace the technical interview and land your dream job. Learning data structures will help you understand how software works and improve your problem-solving skills. In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement linear probing to handle collisions in a hash table data structure with JavaScript.


If you're new to data structures, you may want to start with [Data Structures in JavaScript: Array](https://jarednielsen.com/data-structure-array-javascript/)


## Retrieval Practice

Retrieval practice is the surest way to solidify any new learning. Attempt to answer the following questions before proceeding: 

* What is a hash table? 

* What is hashing?

* TODO


### What is a Hash Table?

A hash table is a data structure that allows us to quickly look up values using a key. 


### What is Hashing?

Hashing is creating a key to use when looking up a value in a hash table.

## Let's Get Meta

Programming is problem solving. Both are metacognitive activities. To excel, we want to improve our thinking _about_ thinking. Ask yourself the following questions and keep them back of mind as you proceed: 
 
* What is a collision?

## How to Implement Hash Table Separate Chainnig in JavaScript

Let's pick up where we left off in our previous tutorial, [Data Structures in JavaScript: Hash Table](https://jarednielsen.com/data-structure-hash-table-javascript/).

For reference, our complete hash table class looks like this: 
```js
class HashTable {
    constructor() {
        this.table = [];
    }

    modularHash(key) {
        let sum = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < key.length; ++i) {
            sum += key.charCodeAt(i);
        }

        let hash = sum % 71; 

        return hash;
    }

    put(key, value) {
        let hash = this.modularHash(key);
        return this.table[hash] = value;
    }

    get(key) {
        return this.table[this.modularHash(key)];
    }

    remove(key) {
        return delete this.table[this.modularHash(key)];
    }


}

const hashTable = new HashTable();
```

We were previously using our hash table to store Twitter handles and then looking them up by the users given name. For example, if I _put_ my name and Twitter handle in our hash table: 
```js
hashTable.put("Jared Nielsen", "@jarednielsen");
```

...logging our table returns: 
```sh
HashTable { table: [ <29 empty items>, '@jarednielsen' ] }
```

I can get my handle calling the `get` method with my given name: 
```js
let query = hashTable.get("Jared Nielsen");
```

‚òùÔ∏è We discovered a problem if we _put_ the following key / value pairs in our table: 
```js
hashTable.put("NASA", "@nasa");
hashTable.put("ASAN", "@asan");
```

What's the problem? 

If we log our table, we see that "ASAN" overwrites "NASA": 
```sh
HashTable {
  table: [ <7 empty items>, '@asan', <21 empty items>, '@jarednielsen' ]
}
```

Do you see the gravity of the situation? üòâ

It's like two cars trying to park in the same spot. What do we call this IRL? 

A collision. 

Our hash function created the same key for two different values, and, in this implementation, the subsequent value is overwriting the previous. 

What's the solution? 

There are two primary approaches to handling collisions in a hash table: [chained hashing](https://jarednielsen.com/data-structure-hash-table-separate-chaining/) (the topic of a previous tutorial) and open address hashing (the topic of this tutorial!). We _could_ use a [perfect hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function), but that's a topic for another day (or book!).

Let's return to the car analogy. If there aren't enough parking spots for two vehicles, what do we do? We could build a parking garage or we could hire a valet. A parking garage would allow us to "stack" cars on top of each other and a valet would allow us to "abstract" the details by parking the cars in some other location. 

How can we store more than one value at a given index in an array? 

ü§î

We don't!

We just park it somewhere else.

### What is a Collision? 

A collision occurs in a hash table when our put method attempts to store multiple values at the same hash index.
