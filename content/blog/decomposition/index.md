## TODO How to Solve It

Before we break a problem down, we need to understand it. 

The first step in understanding the problem is to define both the starting point, or current state, and the end point, or goal. 



In _How to Solve It_, George Polya provides some advice on how to understand the problem: 

* Restate in own words

* Draw pictures and diagrams 

* Address the unknowns

### Decomposition

What is decomposition? 

Breaking a problem down into smaller, more manageable, parts. 

How would you eat a watermelon? 

Unless it was very small or your mouth was very big, you would need to cut, or divide, it into bite-size pieces. 


TODO real-world example
 
The same is true for any programming problem. 

A common strategy in decomposition is to ask "What is the smallest problem I can solve?"

If, for example, you are writing a sorting algorithm. The smallest problem to be solved is an array or list continaing two elements:
```
[2, 1]
```

You can then begin building a solution to this problem, after which you move on to the next smallest problem, something like: 
```
[2, 3, 1]
```

And so on...


#### Factoring

### TODO subtract

In _Subtract_, Leidy Klotz outlines what he calls the _lesslist_. It consists of the following four steps: 

* Subtract before improving

* Make subtracting first

* Persist to noticeable less

* Reuse your subtractions
