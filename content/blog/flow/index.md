@TODO what’s the hook?

## What is Flow?


In [Flow](https://amzn.to/35NmVb3) Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines flow as “... the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter….” He continues:

> ‘Flow’ is the way people describe their state of mind when consciousness is harmoniously ordered, and they want to pursue whatever they are doing for its own sake.

Programmers often refer to this phenomenon as being in 'The Zone'. We can also describe this as _optimal experience_. According to Csikszentmihalyi: 

> The best moments usually occur when a persons’ body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something we can make happen.”

@TODO 

> The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy--or attention--is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action. The pursuit of a goal brings order in consciousness because a person must concentrate attention on the task at hand and momentarily forget everything else.


## Why Flow?

A flow state is an optimal experience. We can use this optimal experience to optimize our most precious resource: attention. According to Csikszentmihalyi: 

> Attention is like energy in that without it no work can be done, and in doing work it is dissipated. We create ourselves by how we invest this energy.

Attnetion is our psychic energy and we use it to Get Things Done (GTD). More than that, and perhaps more importantly, flow can help us find happiness. 

> ...in the long run, optimal experiences add up to a sense of mastery--or perhaps better, a sense of participation in determining the content of life--that comes as close to what is usually meant by happiness as anything else we can conceivably imagine.

@TODO 

“The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distracitons, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer. And the person who can do this usually enjoys the normal course of everyday life.”


## How Do We Flow? 

In [Flow](https://amzn.to/35NmVb3), Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi outlines the **The Elements of Enjoyment**, or, the @TODO required to achieve flow: 

1. **A Challenging Activity that Requires Skill**

There's a balance to strike between boredom and anxiety. If the activity is too easy, we will feel bored. If the activity is too difficult, we will feel anxious. We need to be engaged in a task that pushes us just beyond our limits. Lastly, we need to know _how_ to solve the problem at hand. According to Csikszentmihalyi: 

> ...the overwhelming proportion of optimal experiences are reported to occur within sequences of activities that are goal-directed and bounded by rules--activities that require the investment of psychic energy, and that could not be done without the appropriate skills.


2. **The Merging of Action and Awareness**


“When all a person’s relevant skills are needed to cope with the challenges of a situation, that person’s attention is completely absorbed by the activity.
    “As a result, one of the most universal and distinctive features of optimal experience takes place: people become so involved in what they are doing that the activity becomes spontaneous, almost automatic; they stop being aware of themselves as separate from the actions they are performing.”

3. **Clear Goals**

We also need a clear idea of the problem we are solving (or creating, for that matter), because, again, with no goal, we will feel either bored or anxious, unless we are Zen masters. 

“The reason it is possible to achieve such complete involvement in a flow experience is that goals are usually clear, and feedback immediate.”



4. **Feedback**

“The kind of feedback we work toward is in and of itself often unimportant... What makes this information valuable is the symbolic message it contains: that I have succeeded in my goal”


5. **Concentration on the Task at Hand**

“...the clearly structured demands of the activity impose order, and exclude the interference of disorder in consciousness.”


6. **The Paradox of Control**

“,,,the flow experience is typically described as having a sense of control--or, more precisely, as lacking the sense of worry about losing control that is typical in many situations in normal life.”

“...activities that produce flow experience, even the seemingly most risky ones, are so constructed as to allow the practitioner to develop sufficient skills to reduce the margin of error to as close to zero as possible.”

What’s the paradox? Flow activities can become addictive:

“When a person becomes so dependent on the ability to control an enjoyable activity that he cannot pay attention to anything else, then he loses the ultimate control: the freedom to determine the content of consciousness.”

7. **The Loss of Self-Consciousness**
“...in flow there is no room for self-scrutiny. Because enjoyable activities have clear goals, stable rules, and challenges well matched to skills, there is little opportunity for the self to be threatened.”

8. **The Transformation of Time**
“...time no longer seems to pass the way it ordinarily does. The objective, external duration we measure with reference to outside events like night and day, or the orderly progression of clocks, is rendered irrelevant by the rhythms dictated by the activity.”


## How does Flow relate to programming?

In [Code Complete](https://amzn.to/2JCCarc), Steve McConnell states that Software’s Primary Technical Imperative is to _Conquer Complexity_.  

> Although it’s tempting to try to be a hero and deal with computer-science problems at all levels, no one’s brain is really capable of spanning nine orders of magnitude of detail. Computer science and software engineering have developed many intellectual tools for handling such complexity…

McConnell provides a few examples of these intellectual tools:

> When you put a complicated test into a boolean function and abstract the purpose of the test, you make the code less complex. When you substitute a table lookup for a complicated chain of logic, you do the same thing. When you create a well-defined, consistent class interface, you eliminate the need to worry about implementation details of the class and you simplify your job overall.

Like flow, we want to bring order to chaos, or conquer complexity, long enough for us to GTD. We can do that by using coding conventiosn to clear a path to our goal by eliminating decision fatigue. According to McConnel, “...conventions are the most useful when they spare you the trouble of making and defending arbitrary decisions.” He continues:

> The point of having coding conventions is… mainly to reduce complexity. When you can standardize decisions about formatting, loops, variable names, modeling notations, and so on, you release mental resources that you need to focus on more challenging aspects of the programming problem.”


## Flow Requires Friction

But! In order to GTD, we need to first learn the skills to accomplish our goals. And that requires the opposite of flow: friction. Learning to program requires _a lot_ of friction because, well, formal languages aren't _natural_. Formal langagues require more effort. According to Barbara Oakley in in [A Mind for Numbers](https://amzn.to/2UWpClG):

> Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven’t evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language. Obviously, we can still think _about_ math and science--it’s just that the _abstractness_ and _encryptedness_ adds a level--sometimes a number of levels--of complexity. 




> Research has show that the more effort you put into recalling material, the deeper it embeds itelf into your memory. Recall, not simple rereading, is the bst form of deliberate practice in study. Building a chunked library of ways to solve problems is effective precisely because it is builton methods of retrieval practice. 




> If you find yourself avoiding certain tasks because they make you uncomfortable, there is a great way to reframe things: Learn to focus on _process_, not _product_.

> The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead, you need to focus on the _process_, the small chunks of time you need over days or weeks.

> If you learn under mild stress, you can handle greater stress muhc more easily. 

> One of the single most important pieces of advice I can give you on dealing with procrastination is to _ignore distractions_!



Sustaining effort and focus while learning a formal language is challenging. Oakley counsels us to focus on the _process_ and not the _product_:

> By focusing on _process_ rather than _product_, you allow yourself to back away from judging yourself and allow yourself to relax into the flow of the work.

Friction is required to _make it stick_. According to the authors of [Make It Stick](https://amzn.to/2QTzklN): 

> The easier knowledge or a skill is for you to retrieve, the less your retrieval practice will benefit your retention of it. Conversely, the more effort you have to expend to retrieve knowledge or skill, the more the practice of retrieval will entrench it. 



> Two familiar lessons: First, some difficulties require more effort and slow down apparent gains--like spacing, interleaving, and mixing up practice--will feel less productive at the time but will more than compensate for that by making the learning stronger, precise, and enduring. Second, that our judgments of what learning strategies work best for us are often mistaken, colored by illusions of mastery.

> This paradox is at the heart of the concept of desirable difficulties in learning: the more effort required to retrieve (or, in effect, relearn) something, the better you learn it. In other words, the more you’ve forgotten about a topic, the more effective relearning will be in shaping your permanent knowledge. 

> The more effort that is required to recall a memory or to execute a skill, provided that the effort succeeds, the more the act of recalling or executing benefits the learning. 

> It’s the effortful process of reconstructing the knowledge that triggers reconsolidation and deeper learning.
