TODO 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to do the following: 

* ...

* ...

* ...

The focus of this tutorial is on Actions and Docker, so we will be 

In order to demonstrate Actions, we will need to build a custom Docker image. To keep things simple, we're simply going to extend [the official build of nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx).   


## Create a Repository on GitHub 

Create a new repository and initialize it with a README. You can name it whatever you want, but I'll be using the name `nginxer` throughout this tutorial. 

Then clone the repository and `cd` into it. 


## Create Our Files

We're going to work with two files throughout this tutorial: 

* `index.html`

* `Dockerfile`

Let's create both of them now:
```sh
touch index.html Dockerfile
```

### TODO HTML

If you're using VSCode (who isn't?), simply type `html` and select the the `html

Let's add some boilerplate to the `index.html` file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

Let's personalize it a bit and change the title and add and `<h1>` to the body. 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Dockerment</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1> Whale, Hello There! üêã </h1>
    <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/qhhamrBnxSKNG" width="480" height="480" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/whale-qhhamrBnxSKNG">via GIPHY</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

### TODO Dockerfile

Now let's edit our Docker file. Because we're keeping this simple so we can get to the Actions, we're simply going to build on the official nginx image. We do so by adding the following to our `Dockerfile`:
```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest 
```

nginx requires us to serve our `index.html` file from `/usr/share/nginx/html/`, so let's add a line to copy it over when the image is built: 
```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest
COPY ./index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```
