What are you learning this year?

Perhaps we need to reframe the question: _how_ are you learning this year?

Did you make resolutions to learn `x` or build `y` with new hotness `z`?

How‚Äôs it going so far?

Most people don‚Äôt stick with their resolutions. Something like 80% of people drop their Gregorian calendar goals by Chinese New Year.

Why?

We can boil it down to two factors:

* the goal is too ambitious or too ambiguous or both

* the goal focuses on product, not process

These are two sides of the same coin.

If we clearly define our goals and determine a realistic scope, we can focus on the process.

If we focus on the process, we can achieve amibitious and ambiguous goals.

‚ÄúThat makes for a nice tweet,‚Äù I hear you say. ‚ÄúBut I need to know this now!‚Äù

As the proverb goes, "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." 

We can't download this stuff into our brains. Yet. 

Our only recourse is to _do the work_. 

Every day. 

To do that, we need to make it a habit. 

According to a [study conducted in 2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674), it takes the average individual 66 days to form a habit. 

Did you already abandon your New Year's resolution? 

If so, you quit too soon.

And that's okay. 

New Year's resolutions are üêéüí©.

But don't wait until January 1st of next year to start again. 

How about now?
