How does the word mathematics make you feel? 

Excited? 

Full of dread? 

Our experience with mathematics colors our perception of it, and for most of us, that depends entirely on our early experiences. 

If you were lucky, your mathematics teachers were good. Mine were not. They were hired for their successes in sports, not statistics. 

Seriously. 

My algebra teacher was the wrestling coach. 

My geometry teacher was the volleyball coach.

My trigonometry teacher was the basketball coach. 

I didn‚Äôt enroll in calculus because I thought mathematics was boring AF and I was not interested in football.

Nothing against sports. But being a former wrestling champion does not qualify you to teach algebra. (I‚Äôm looking at you, Mr. Chappell.)

My English, music, and art teachers, on the other hand, were awesome, so I went to college and earned a BFA in Media and Performing Arts.

No regrets. But then I foolishly earned an MFA, which is a story for another day‚Ä¶

Whether you are composing a poem or a function, the processes of creativity and problem solving are the same. That‚Äôs what distinguished my humanities teachers from my mathematics teachers, they used their respective subjects of literature, music, and art to reveal historical patterns of human curiosity and invention, which is crazy because sports is mathematics! 

A recent New York Times article, This Book Is Not About Baseball. But Baseball Teams Swear by It., highlights the use of Thinking, Fast and Slow by baseball teams to form organizational evaluations and strategies. It‚Äôs written by Nobel prize winning economist Daniel Kahneman and all based in statistical analysis of psychological studies.

Can sports influence mathematics?

Professors in the Computer Science department at Drew University are developing an athletic approach to software engineering, drawing from crossfit and other performance sports training regimens to ‚Äúput students through the paces‚Äù with workouts-of-the-day. 

Do you need mathematics to succeed as a programmer? 

You can get by with PEMDAS. 

Will learning some maths chops help? 

Immensely.

Do you need to learn probability theory? 

Probably not. 

But what is the probability that you would use it? 

100%

If you are programming in one of the two most popular languages, Python or JavaScript, you are using probability every day in dictionaries and objects. It‚Äôs baked into the design and history of hash tables. In The Art of Computer Programming, Donald Knuth uses the birthday paradox to address one of the problems with hashing: 

Functions that avoid duplicate values are surprisingly rare, even with a fairly large table. For example, the famous ‚Äúbirthday paradox‚Äù asserts that if 23 or more people are present in a room, chances are good that two of them will have the same month and day of birth! In other words, if we select a random function that maps 23 keys into a table of size 365, the probability that no two keys map into the same location is only 0.4927 (less than one-half). 

Wait! 

What? 

Does this seem counterintuitive? 

That's because it is. Our brains are not good at probability. 

Let‚Äôs fix that.

Our goal is to calculate the probability of birthdays between one or more individuals, or P(B), where B is birthday. 

When the problem is framed in such a way, we intuitively think it will require a crowd of people to find two that share a birthday. 

But what if we invert the problem? 

What are the odds that two individuals do not share a birthday? 

364/365

Why? 

Because there is only one chance in 365 that the two individuals share a birthday.

(Note that we are excluding Leap Year, for the sake of simplicity and argument.)

And if there are three individuals, then the odds are 363/365.

And four is 362/365.

If we are calculating the odds that five individuals share a birthday, our equation will look like this: 

1 - (365/365) * (364/365) * (363/365) * (362/365) * (361/365) = 0.0271

There‚Äôs a 2.7% chance there will be a shared birthday among five individuals.

It scales very quickly. If we are calculating the probability that ten individuals share a birthday, the result is 11.7%. And 20 individuals is 41.1%. We reach 99.9% probability with only 70 individuals. (FWIW, we only hit 100% with 366). 

In Hexaflexagons, Probability Paradoxes, and the Tower of Hanoi, Martin Gardner points out that among U.S. presidents, both Polk and Harding were born on November 2nd, and, if we look at deaths, Jefferson, Adams, and Monroe each died on July 4th and Truman and Ford died on December 26th! 

That‚Äôs from a pool of 46. 

Right about now you‚Äôre looking for the Unsubscribe link‚Ä¶ 

Let‚Äôs fix that.

What is the correlation between probability and programming? 

(See what I did there?)

Collisions.

üí•üöó

If we are implementing a hashing function, we need to address situations where one or more values share an index. The birthday paradox quickly reveals the likelihood of a collision, and, perhaps more importantly, how easily we might not see it.
