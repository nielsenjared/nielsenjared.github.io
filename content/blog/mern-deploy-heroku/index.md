There's more than one way to scaffold a boilerplate MERN application and deploy it to Heroku. This method is straightforward and easy to maintain. 

The [repository containing starter code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/nielsenjared/mern)

## Initialize Your Project with npm
```sh
mkdir mern
cd mern
npm init
```

During the init process you will be prompted to add a GitHub repository. Now would be a good time to make a new project on GitHub. Add the repo link to your package.json when prompted.

## Initialize Your Project with Git
```sh
git init
git remote add origin <URL-to-your-repo>
```

Add `node_modules` to your `.gitignore`.

## Set Up a Simple Express Server
```sh
npm install express --save
```

Add a server.js:
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;
app.listen(PORT);
```

Start the server and navigate to localhost:3001 to verify that it works. You don't need to use port 3001, but don't use 3000. That's the default for Create React App.

## Deploy to Heroku
Do not wait until the last minute to deploy! Let’s deploy this now so we can test deployment periodically.

Update package.json:
```js
"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
  "start": "node server.js"
  },
```
Then log into Heroku via the command line and create a new app:
```sh
heroku login
heroku create
```

Verify the creation of your Heroku app by running `git remote -v`.

Then run the following:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m “First”
git push -u origin master
git push heroku master
```
Navigate to the URL provided to verify deployment.

In the future:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m “Ch-ch-ch-changes…”
git push heroku master
```

## MongoDB

Log into Heroku.com and find your app. Under Resources, search for **mLab** in the Add-ons input field and add it as a Provision. If there are no results, you need to add a credit card to your account. Don't worry, it's free.

Just for fun, under Settings, reveal your app config variables. There it is, our MongoDB environment variable, `MONGODB_URI`. You will see how that is used below.

Install Mongoose:
```sh
npm install --save mongoose`
```

Add to server.js:
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect(
  process.env.MONGODB_URI || "mongodb://localhost/mern",
  {
    useNewUrlParser: true
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  }
);

```
Add `models` and `routes` directories to your app:

```
mkdir models routes
```

To these add placeholder `index.js` files:

```
touch models/index.js routes/index.js
```

## React

Install Create React App if you don't already have it:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

From within your the root directory of your app, run

```
create-react-app client
```

Now let's connect the front to the back using concurrently and a proxy:

```
npm install --save concurrently
```

To the package.json in the root directory of your app, add two new scripts:
```js
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node server.js",
    "client": "npm run start --prefix client",
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run start\" \"npm run client\""
  },
```

To the package.json in your client directory, just below "private", add:

```
"proxy": "http://localhost:3001/",
```

From here you will start your app from its root directory with:
```
npm run dev
```

This will start both servers _concurrently_. Try it!

## Heroku, Again

Add the path package:

```
npm install --save path
```

In server.js, replace the 'Hello World!' get route with the following:
```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  app.use(express.static("client/build"));
  const path = require('path');
  app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, 'client', 'build', 'index.html'));
  });
}
```

All requests will be met with the `index.html` file as a response. From there, you will use ReactRouter.

To the package.json in the root directory of your app, add one more script:
```js
"heroku-postbuild": "NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client"
```

Add, commit and push to Heroku. Verify that your app builds and is now live.

Happy routing!
