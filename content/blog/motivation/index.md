@TODO How do you stay motivated? 


## What is intrinsic motivation? 

In Drive, Daniel Pink defines and distinguishes between two behaviors:

* Type X, which is "...fueled more by extrinsic desires than intrinsic ones. It concerns itself less with the inherent satisfaction of an activity and more with the external rewards to which the activity leads.

* Type I, which is … is fueled more by intrinsic desires than extrinsic ones. It concerns itself less with the external rewards to which an activity leads and more with the inherent satisfaction of the activity itself."

Pink adds further distinctions:

* Type I behavior is made, not born.

* Type I’s almost always outperform Type X’s in the long run.

* Type I behavior does not disdain money or recognition.

* Type I behavior is a renewable resource.

* Type I behavior promotes greater physical and mental well-being. 

According to Pink, there are three elements required to @TODO what? 

* Autonomy

* Mastery

* Purpose

In Ultralearning, Scott Young counsels us to answer the question, ‘Why?’ 

Why do we want or need to learn something? 

He divides projects into two types of motivation: 

* Instrumental

* Intrinsic

According to Young, "Instrumental learning projects are those you’re learning with the purpose of achieving a different, nonlearning result". These projects are primarily for the benefit of your career. This is in contrast to intrinsic projects where "you’re learning the subject for its own sake, not as a means to some other outcome." 

> If you’re pursuing a project for mostly instrumental reasons, it’s often a good idea to do an additional step of research: determining whether learning the skill or topic in question will actually help you achieve your goal. 


## Why intrinsic motivation? 

Why would we want to favor intrinsic motivation over instrumental? 

Mihaly ‎Csikszentmihalyi provides an answer in Flow: 

> There is no question that to survive, and especially to survive in a complex society, it is necessary to work for external goals and to postpone immediate gratifications. But a person does not have to be turned into a puppet jerked about by social controls. The solution is to gradually become free of societal rewards and learn how to substitute for them rewards that are under one's own powers. This is not to say that we should abandon every goal endorsed by society; rather, it means that, in addition to or instead of the goals others use to bribe us with, we develop a set of our own.

> Your employer can’t force you to be a good programmer; a lot of times your employer isn’t even in a position to judge whether you’re good. If you want to be great, you’re responsible for making yourself great. It’s a matter of your personal character.

Dave and Andy reiterate this point in [The Pragmatic Programmer](@TODO):
> It’s your life. You own it. You run it. You create it. 

They continue: 

> You are building the future, for yourselves and for your descendants. Your duty is to make it a future that we’d all want to inhabit. Recognize when you’re doing something against this ideal, and have the courage to say ‘no’! Envision the future we _could_ have, and have the courage to create it. Build castles in the air every day. 


## How Do We Stay or Get Motivated?

Stay motivated? Easier said than done. Especially in a year like this one. 

In Ultralearning, Scott Young defines three problems that prevent us from focusing

* Failing to start to focus (AKA procrastination)
> ...the first step to overcoming procrastination: recognize when you are procrastinating. 

* Failing to sustain focus (AKA getting distracted). The sources that cause distractions:

    * Your environment

    * Your task

    * Your mind

* Failing to create the right kind of focus

How do we improve our ability to focus? 

Young's advice is to "…recognize where you are and start small."

Why do we procrastinate? 

According to Barbara Oakley, "We procrastinate about things that make us feel uncomfortable."

In [A Mind for Numbers](@TODO), Barbara Oakley offers strategies for preventing procrastination. The first is to harness your willpower:

> Unlike procrastination, which is easy to fall into, willpower is hard to come by because it uses a lot of neural resources. This means that the _last_ thing you want to do in tackling procrastination is to go around spraying willpower on it like its cheap air freshers. You shouldn’t waste willpower on procrastination except when absolutely necessary!

> The _only_ place you need to apply willpower is to change your reaction to the cue.

The second strategy is to focus on process over product: 

> If you find yourself avoiding certain tasks because they make you uncomfortable, there is a great way to reframe things: Learn to focus on _process_, not _product_.


> The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead, you need to focus on the _process_, the small chunks of time you need over days or weeks.






> The key to rewiring is to have a plan. Developing a new ritual can be helpful. 


> A powerful approach is mental contrasting. In this technique, you think abut where you are now and contrast it with what you ant to achieve. 



In Drive, Pink outlines **Nine Strategies for Awakening Your Motivation**:

1. Give Yourself a “Flow Test”: How might you increase the number of optimal experiences and reduce the moments when you felt disengaged or distracted?

2. First, Ask A Big Question…: What’s your sentence?

3. … Then Keep Asking A Small Question: Was I better today than yesterday?

4. Take a Sagmeister: @TODO 

5. Give Yourself a Performance Review: @TODO

6. Get Unstuck by Going Oblique: @TODO

7. Move Five Steps Closer to Mastery: Remember that deliberate practice has one objective: to improve performance. Repeat, repeat, repeat. Seek constant, critical feedback: Focus ruthlessly on where you need help. Prepare for the process to be mentally and physically exhausting. 

8. Take a page from Webber and a Card From Your Pocket: What gets you up in the morning? What keeps you up at night? 

9. Create Your Own Motivational Poster: Like the one at the top of this post!
