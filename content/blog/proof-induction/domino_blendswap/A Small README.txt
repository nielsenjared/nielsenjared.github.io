--------DOMINO--------

Layer 1 - The Render you see on Blendswap
Layer 2 - The Domino

To use the model, append 'Domino' (from objects) into your secene.  
Each time you duplicate it (SHIFT + D), it will have a random set of numbers.
This will also work with an array modifier, simply apply, then in edit mode split into loose parts.
