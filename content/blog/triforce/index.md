TODO 

## How To Be A Powerful, Courageous, and Wise Programmer

In addition to being pleased that 2022 is behind us, I‚Äôm also pleased (and relieved) to announce the launch of A is for Algorithms. It‚Äôs the 26 building blocks every programmer needs to know, from swap to permutations. 

It‚Äôs also the third and final book in my series on computer science fundamentals, starting with [The Little Book of Big O](TODO) and [The Seven Data Structures of Highly Effective Developers](TODO).

The Triforce is complete!

If you‚Äôre not familiar with it, the Triforce is an artifact of the Legend of Zelda video game franchise, with much of the game play centered on gathering and recombining its three pieces. According to Ye Olde Wikipedia:

> When the three pieces of the Triforce are combined, they create a divine artifact that has the power to grant any wish. For this reason, the combined Triforce has been the main source of struggle for control within the series, due to its limitless power.
 
The pieces of the Triforce represent Power, Courage, and Wisdom.

According to Merriam-Webster, these are the definitions for each of these attributes: 
    
* **Power**: _ability to act or produce an effect_
    
* **Courage**: _mental or moral strength to venture, persevere, and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty_
    
* **Wisdom**: _ability to discern inner qualities and relationships_

I love a good framework, and these easily map to Algorithms, Big O, and Data Structures. 

Table time! üèì
 
| Triforce attribute    | Computer science topic    |
|---                    |---                        |
| Power                 | Algorithms                |
| Courage               | Data structures           |
| Wisdom                | Big O                     |

Like the Triforce, possessing knowledge of these three compsci topics can grant (almost) any wish. Combined, they establish the foundation for solving any programming problem. 

### Algorithms == Power

We can think of algorithms as items in Link‚Äôs inventory, equipping our hero with tools to crawl dungeon after dungeon. But, as we‚Äôve seen over the last few years, algorithms can cause massive societal change, both positive and negative. ‚ÄúWith great power comes great responsibility.‚Äù Oh, wait. That‚Äôs Spider-Man. But still applicable here. 

### Data Structures == Courage

As the Hero‚Äôs Shade says in Twilight Princess, ‚ÄúA sword wields no strength unless the hand that holds it has courage.‚Äù And an algorithm is only as strong as the data structure that supports it. You can only do so much without an array. Even then, at some point, an array becomes limiting and you need an object or dictionary. Or a tree. Or a graph. Or a Link-ed list ;)


### Big O == Wisdom

In The Ocarina of Time, Zelda tells Link, ‚ÄúThe flow of time is always cruel‚Ä¶‚Äù  So is the flow of space! With Big O, we demonstrate wisdom by analyzing the performance of our algorithms and asking the question: ‚ÄúCan we do better?‚Äù 


## From Algorithms to Zelda

Learning computer sciecne is an adventure.

It's dangerous to go alone! To aid you on your journey, I created a bundle of books: [The Triforce of Computer Science](TODO)

It features the following: 

* A is for Algorithms

* The Seven Data Structures of Highly Effective Developers

* The Little Book of Big O

If you‚Äôre in a position where you can‚Äôt afford this, let me know.

May you be powerful, courageous, and wise this year.

Cheers!
