![ The Triforce ](./jarednielsen-triforce-computer-science.png)


There are countless programming analogies we can draw from video games. One of the longest running and widely recognized games is _The Legend of Zelda_. The series follows the adventures of Link, a young hero who drops out of college to launch a successful startup in a Palo Alto garage and changes the world as we know it. 

How did Link succeed in his quest? 

He equipped himself with [The Triforce of Computer Science](https://jarednielsen.gumroad.com/l/computerscience): algorithms, data structures, and Big O. 

If you‚Äôre not familiar with it, the Triforce is an artifact of _The Legend of Zelda_ video game franchise, with much of the game play centered on gathering and recombining its three pieces. According to Ye Olde Wikipedia: 
> When the three pieces of the Triforce are combined, they create a divine artifact that has the power to grant any wish. For this reason, the combined Triforce has been the main source of struggle for control within the series, due to its limitless power.
 
The pieces of the Triforce represent _power_, _courage_, and _wisdom_.

According to Merriam-Webster, the definitions for each of these attributes are as follows: 
    
* **Power**: _ability to act or produce an effect_
    
* **Courage**: _mental or moral strength to venture, persevere, and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty_
    
* **Wisdom**: _ability to discern inner qualities and relationships_

I love a good framework, and these easily map to Algorithms, Big O, and Data Structures. 

Table time! üèì
 
| Triforce attribute    | Computer science topic    |
|---                    |---                        |
| Power                 | Algorithms                |
| Courage               | Data structures           |
| Wisdom                | Big O                     |

Like the Triforce, possessing knowledge of these three compsci topics can grant (almost) any wish. Combined, they establish the foundation for solving any programming problem. 


### ‚öîÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏è Power ‚Ü¶ Algorithms

According to Ye Olde Wikipedia, an _algorithm_ is: 
> a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation

We can think of algorithms as items in Link‚Äôs inventory, equipping our hero with the tools required to crawl dungeon after dungeon, battle bosses, and build apps for villagers. The more algorithms you acquire, the more you can accomplish. You will also want to collect more powerful algorithms. Don't expect to vanquish Ganon with the Bubble Sword. You'll want the Quick Sword for that. But, as we‚Äôve seen over the last few years, algorithms can cause massive societal change, both positive and negative.

> With great power comes great responsibility.

Oh, wait. That‚Äôs Spider-Man. But still applicable here. 

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Courage ‚Ü¶ Data Structures

According to Ye Olde Wikipedia, a _data structure_ is: 
> a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

Like heart containers, data structures store the life energy of a program. As the Hero‚Äôs Shade says in _Twilight Princess_:

> A sword wields no strength unless the hand that holds it has courage.

And an algorithm is only as strong as the data structure that supports it. You can only accomplish so much without an array. Even then, at some point, an array becomes limiting and you need a tree. Or a graph. Or a Link-ed list ;)


### ü¶â Wisdom ‚Ü¶ Big O

According to Ye Olde Wikipedia, _Big O_ is a a mathematical notation: 
> used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows

In _The Ocarina of Time_, Zelda tells Link: 

> The flow of time is always cruel‚Ä¶

So is the flow of space! 

With Big O, we demonstrate wisdom by analyzing the performance of our algorithms and asking the question: ‚ÄúCan we do better?‚Äù 


## How To Be A Powerful, Courageous, and Wise Programmer

Learning to program is an adventure. 

It's dangerous to go alone! Take this: [The Triforce of Computer Science](https://jarednielsen.gumroad.com/l/computerscience)

It's a bundle featuring the following computer science books: 

* A is for Algorithms

* The Seven Data Structures of Highly Effective Developers

* The Little Book of Big O

May you be a powerful, courageous, and wise programmer.
