Approaching material with a goal of learning it on your own gives you a unique path to mastery.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But Barbara, sometimes learning is difficult!</p>\n<p>This is a good thing.</p>\n<h2>Embrace Difficulty</h2>\n<p>The authors of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QTzklN\">Make It Stick</a>, counsel us to embrace difficulty:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Difficulty in learning new things is not only to be expected but can be beneficial.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How do you persist in persistence?</p>\n<p>Habits.</p>\n<p>üôÑ</p>\n<p>Yes, I‚Äôm making a habit of habits.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NZz8jx\">Atomic Habits</a>, James Clear defines ‚ÄúThe Goldilocks Rules‚Äù, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚Ä¶humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We need to be challenged, not only to learn, but to build the habit of learning.</p>\n<p>According to Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel, learning is at least a three-step process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Encoding</strong>: information is held in short-term working memory before being consolidated into a cohesive representation of knowledge in long-term memory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consolidation</strong>: reorganizes and stabilizes memory traces, gives them meaning, and makes connections to past experiences and to tohter knowledge already stored in long-term memory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Retrieval</strong>: updates learning and enables you to apply it when you need it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>They write that, ‚Äúretrieval practice that‚Äôs easy does little to strengthen learning; the more difficult the practice, the greater the benefit.‚Äù</p>\n<p>If the problem is too easy, we‚Äôll get bored.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us.‚Äù James Clear continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What if the problem is too difficult?</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://amzn.to/30BVrAW\">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>, authors Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas offer several strategies for solving impossible problems, the first being:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don‚Äôt think outside the box‚Äî<em>find</em> the box!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We often dismiss potential solutions too readily due to our preconceived notions. They write that, ‚Äúthe secret is to identify the real (not imagined) constraints, and find a solution therein.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Can you connect all of the ducks and return to the starting point with just three straight, connected lines?</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/29114/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.32911392405063%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAAC4jAAAuIwF4pT92AAAA2klEQVQoz52S3Q6CMAxGfWkSfUKN12qiJpp44x+RqdN1bOtnLIogsBgbGnoxDt8p9NBSzFzemUNtZjDkep35rh46qvrAG/r9sp+B78P+rpBfNjIH0rBqHYVFgEUic5xgNx7AUQqnD9gOE5CaN1LXgMVumi2pghFAyDUYHnRewlNW2Wmz48r6BKtWBdxcQKdFXblFvSNhoUPpFLtxH87s4W8ptqMElM1KZW5JGld2GqQWCPkV7A3sU9mqD7BNuQsoKdmLFnsrLXPw4OD+AaJUqu5WfuzYR+kG/tcP6JJjz+FJiOYAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"jarednielsen solution embrace difficulty puzzle unsolved\"\n        title=\"jarednielsen solution embrace difficulty puzzle unsolved\"\n        src=\"/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/f058b/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/c26ae/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png 158w,\n/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/6bdcf/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png 315w,\n/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/f058b/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png 630w,\n/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/40601/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png 945w,\n/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/78612/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png 1260w,\n/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/29114/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png 1920w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>How would you solve this problem?</p>\n<p>(The solution is above.)</p>\n<p>Sometimes you need to just get out of your own way!</p>\n<p>Take a break.</p>\n<p>Do something fun.</p>\n<p>Let your diffuse mode work on the problem.</p>\n<p>If that doesn‚Äôt work, ask for help.</p>\n<p>Ask someone to ask you the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Why are you solving this problem?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What‚Äôs the benefit of solving it?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are the problems you‚Äôre having related to edge cases?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is there a simpler, related problem you can solve?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there‚Äôs no one around, talk to the duck.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Hunt and Thomas remind us that, ‚ÄúFortune favors the prepared mind‚Äù:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In order to have eureka! moments, your nonconscious brain needs to have plenty of raw material; prior experiences that can contribute to an answer.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Embrace Difficulty","date":"April 20, 2020","description":"The key to success in life and learning is to embrace difficulty.
