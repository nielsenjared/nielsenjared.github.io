Approaching material with a goal of learning it on your own gives you a unique path to mastery.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But Barbara, sometimes learning is difficult! </p>\n<p>This is a good thing. </p>\n<h2>Embrace Difficulty</h2>\n<p>The authors of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QTzklN\">Make It Stick</a>, counsel us to embrace difficulty: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Difficulty in learning new things is not only to be expected but can be beneficial. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How do you persist in persistence? </p>\n<p>Habits.</p>\n<p>üôÑ</p>\n<p>Yes, I‚Äôm making a habit of habits. </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NZz8jx\">Atomic Habits</a>, James Clear defines ‚ÄúThe Goldilocks Rules‚Äù, which states that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚Ä¶humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We need to be challenged, not only to learn, but to build the habit of learning. </p>\n<p>According to Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel, learning is at least a three-step process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Encoding</strong>: information is held in short-term working memory before being consolidated into a cohesive representation of knowledge in long-term memory.</li>\n<li><strong>Consolidation</strong>: reorganizes and stabilizes memory traces, gives them meaning, and makes connections to past experiences and to tohter knowledge already stored in long-term memory.</li>\n<li><strong>Retrieval</strong>: updates learning and enables you to apply it when you need it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>They write that, ‚Äúretrieval practice that‚Äôs easy does little to strengthen learning; the more difficult the practice, the greater the benefit.‚Äù</p>\n<p>If the problem is too easy, we‚Äôll get bored. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us.‚Äù James Clear continues: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What if the problem is too difficult? </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://amzn.to/30BVrAW\">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>, authors Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas offer several strategies for solving impossible problems, the first being:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don‚Äôt think outside the box‚Äî<em>find</em> the box!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We often dismiss potential solutions too readily due to our preconceived notions. They write that, ‚Äúthe secret is to identify the real (not imagined) constraints, and find a solution therein.‚Äù </p>\n<p>Can you connect all of the ducks and return to the starting point with just three straight, connected lines? </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/a987b/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAAC4jAAAuIwF4pT92AAAA4UlEQVQoz52STwuCQBDF+9zRpT5Ul04duhR1Kgg6BAn9g8xKXXVn5qW7KZYa1uhjB8Z5zG/WDmpCRIpThCHZk+elWl100BBvDfKl1sYwb9DeHsFhYnLyXfjOOK3R7xNmaFlE7hrHWQ9JeACpC47TLpS7fPumYmh3UxXMy2AdFHtkHUKYSvutqmZCKXCS6w4PZ/RCvuC+HaaGUQlZ2k5ocWJvg/NiAJ0hRx5O8z7UdVUgG5DPCZuR0waOQfEtRVUQUuD4DqbIXEz+C7U2tA1kxdrK5PSvYXVDUjobL6XZ8D89AW03Y9z3dnnhAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"jarednielsen solution embrace difficulty puzzle unsolved\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/b9e4f/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/cf440/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png 148w,\n/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/d2d38/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png 295w,\n/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/b9e4f/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png 590w,\n/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/f9b6a/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png 885w,\n/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/2d849/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png 1180w,\n/static/50e98af0a1fe97ba67ef952c4e0efad1/a987b/jarednielsen-solution-embrace-difficulty-puzzle-unsolved.png 1920w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>How would you solve this problem? </p>\n<p>(The solution is above.)</p>\n<p>Sometimes you need to just get out of your own way!</p>\n<p>Take a break.</p>\n<p>Do something fun.</p>\n<p>Let your diffuse mode work on the problem. </p>\n<p>If that doesn‚Äôt work, ask for help. </p>\n<p>Ask someone to ask you the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why are you solving this problem? </li>\n<li>What‚Äôs the benefit of solving it?</li>\n<li>Are the problems you‚Äôre having related to edge cases? </li>\n<li>Is there a simpler, related problem you can solve?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there‚Äôs no one around, talk to the duck.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Hunt and Thomas remind us that, ‚ÄúFortune favors the prepared mind‚Äù: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In order to have eureka! moments, your nonconscious brain needs to have plenty of raw material; prior experiences that can contribute to an answer. </p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Embrace Difficulty","date":"April 20, 2020","description":"The key to success in life and learning is to embrace difficulty.
