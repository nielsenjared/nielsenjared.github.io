This feeling is so extraordinarily common that it even has a name‚Äîthe ‚Äúimpostor phenomenon‚Äù.

You will carve out a piece of land from which you can stand and shout: ‚ÄúThis is what I know!‚Äù</p>\n<p>James Clear explains this process in Atomic Habits:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. Old tasks become easier the second time around, but it doesn‚Äôt get easier overall because now you‚Äôre pouring your energy into the next challenge. Each habit unlocks the next level of performance. It‚Äôs an endless cycle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clear outlines a simple formula for gaining mastery:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery</code></pre></div>\n<p>But mastery is more than just habits and practice.</p>\n<p>Learn how to learn.</p>\n<p>True mastery is being comfortable not knowing something yet confident in your ability to learn it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Overcome Impostor Syndrome: A Guide for Gaining Mastery","date":"March 24, 2023","description":"We're all impostors.
