After that, forgetting begins to slow, but the lesson is clear: a central challenge to improving the way we learn is finding a way to interrupt the process of forgetting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How do we interrupt the process of forgetting?</p>\n<p>Repetition.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhen you learn something new, connections are formed between neurons in your brain,‚Äù writes Julie Dirksen in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2wxA5Kx\">Design for How People Learn</a>. She continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Connections that are reinforced become stronger and more durable. And, like a path that sees dwindling traffic, connections that aren‚Äôt reinforced will usually fade or become irretrievable. Repetition and practice are necessary to successfully retain most learning for the long term.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For most of us, through formal education, this meant rote memorization.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIf you repeat something over and over, eventually you will wear a groove into your long-term memory,‚Äù but, as Dirksen outlines, there are limitations to this approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It only makes one association in your memory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You don‚Äôt have experience using it in multiple contexts, so it‚Äôs more difficult to take that information and transfer it to a variety of situations</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You likely have sequential rather than random access to the information.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the brute force approach to learning.</p>\n<p>And as we all know, it‚Äôs brutal.</p>\n<p>And as we can see, it‚Äôs inefficient.</p>\n<p>There must be a better way!</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs called testing.</p>\n<p>üò©</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs probably not what you wanted to hear.</p>\n<p>This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean taking a formal test.</p>\n<p>As lifelong learners, we need to find our own means to test ourselves.</p>\n<p>What does this look like?</p>\n<p>Reflection.</p>\n<p>(See what I did there.)</p>\n<p>The authors of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QTzklN\">Make It Stick</a> write:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reflection can involve several cognitive activities that lead to stronger learning: retrieving knowledge and earlier training from memory, connecting these to new experiences, and visualizing and mentally rehearsing what you might do differently next time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The more we practice retrieving knowledge from memory the easier it becomes to do so again in the future.</p>\n<p>This is known as the <em>testing effect</em>.</p>\n<p>There are two types of retrieval practice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Effortful</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repeated</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Effortful retrieval</strong> ‚Äúmakes for stronger learning and retention. We‚Äôre easily seduced into believing that learning is better when it‚Äôs easier, but the research shows the opposite: when the mind has to work, learning sticks better.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>Repeated retrieval</strong> ‚Äúnot only makes memories more durable but produces knowledge that can be retrieved more readily, in more varied settings, and applied to a weider variety of problems.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Reflection and retrieval are much more efficient and effective strategies than rote memorization.</p>\n<p>And much more fun.</p>\n<p>As Robert and Michel Root-Bernstein write in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2UhVpgo\">Sparks of Genius</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Making patterns for oneself is a lot more fun than memorizing ‚Äî and a lot more valuable. Teasing apart one pattern and composing another requires real understanding of the basic elements of phenomena and processes. More, it opens up whole new worlds of knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Improve Learning and Memory with Retrieval Practice","date":"April 06, 2020","description":"How do we learn anything?
