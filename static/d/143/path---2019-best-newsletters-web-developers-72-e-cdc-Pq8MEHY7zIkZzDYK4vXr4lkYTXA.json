It’s all here.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.tldrnewsletter.com/\">TL;DR</a></h2>\n<p>This is a daily dose of tech news curated for developers. There are of course links to the big stories of the day but also interesting GitHub repos and projects of interest.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://ponyfoo.com/weekly\">Pony Foo Weekly</a></h2>\n<p>This newsletter is great for its cross-cutting aggregation of recent developments in web development with the added benefit of arriving earlier in the week than others.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://javascriptweekly.com/\">JavaScript Weekly</a></h2>\n<p>In addition to updates on the rapidly evolving JavaScript ecosystem, this newsletter is loaded with tutorials for every skill level as well as links to new and interesting projects. And if you want to really nerd out, you can sign up for the following, but note that the most important stories trickle up to JavaScript Weekly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\">Node Weekly</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"\">React Status</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.pythonweekly.com/\">Python Weekly</a></h2>\n<p>If you’re a JS developer looking for a second language to learn, might I suggest Python? This newsletter is consistently good and if you’re interested in machine learning, you’ll find great resources for all levels.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://programmingdigest.net/\">Programming Digest</a></h2>\n<p>This understated missive is excellent in its lean curation of high-level, language-agnostic articles on its stated topic. Delivered on Sunday’s, it’s one of my favorite weekend reads.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.pointer.io/\">Pointer.io</a></h2>\n<p>Pointer tends to address concerns related to management, both inter- and intra- personal. There is something perspective-changing in every issue, no matter where you are in your career trajectory.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/\">History of the Web</a></h2>\n<p>There is no urgency in reading this newsletter as it is all old news, but it is definitely in the need-to-know category. Each issue is a deep-dive into a ‘forgotten’ history of the web. The issues are always fascinating and always informative.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.densediscovery.com/\">Dense Discovery</a></h2>\n<p>There are a number of frontend/design/UX/UI newsletters out there, but this relative newcomer is fast becoming my favorite for its critical perspective on the field delivered with a dose of humor.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://labnotes.org/\">Weekend Reads</a></h2>\n<p>Last but not least, the newsletter that equips me with memes for Monday. It’s a humorous take on the world of web development, with a lean towards the front-end. LMAO just thinking about it.</p>\n<p>What are your best newsletters?
