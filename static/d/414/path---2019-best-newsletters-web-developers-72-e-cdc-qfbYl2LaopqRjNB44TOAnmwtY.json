Itâ€™s all here.</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¨ <a href=\"https://hackernewsletter.com/\">Hacker Newsletter</a></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.tldrnewsletter.com/\">TL;DR</a></h2>\n<p>This is a daily dose of tech news curated for developers. There are of course links to the big stories but also interesting GitHub repos and projects.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://ponyfoo.com/weekly\">Pony Foo Weekly</a></h2>\n<p>This newsletter is great for its cross-cutting aggregation of recent developments in web development with the added benefit of arriving earlier in the week than others.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://javascriptweekly.com/\">JavaScript Weekly</a></h2>\n<p>In addition to updates on the rapidly evolving JavaScript ecosystem, this newsletter is loaded with tutorials for every skill level as well as links to new and interesting projects. And if you want to really nerd out, you can sign up for its sister publications, Node Weekly and React Status, but note that the most important stories bubble up to JavaScript Weekly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodeweekly.com/\">Node Weekly</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://react.statuscode.com/\">React Status</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.pythonweekly.com/\">Python Weekly</a></h2>\n<p>If youâ€™re a JS developer looking for a second language to learn, might I suggest Python? This newsletter is consistently good and if youâ€™re interested in machine learning, youâ€™ll find great resources for all levels.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.pointer.io/\">Pointer</a></h2>\n<p>Pointer tends to address concerns related to management, both inter- and intra- personal. There is something perspective-changing in every issue, no matter where you are in your career trajectory as a web developer.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/\">History of the Web</a></h2>\n<p>There is no urgency in reading this newsletter as it is all old news, but it is definitely in the need-to-know category. Each issue is a deep-dive into a â€˜forgottenâ€™ history of the web. The issues are always fascinating and always informative.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/newsletter/developer/\">Mozilla Developer Newsletter</a></h2>\n<p>The MDN newsletter rounds out those listed above with links to resources for noobs and pros on accessibility, privacy, performance and beyond. Bonus: weekly developer tools tips (but for Firefox, naturally).</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://programmingdigest.net/\">Programming Digest</a></h2>\n<p>This understated missive is excellent in its lean curation of high-level, language-agnostic articles on its stated topic. I look forward to its arrival every Sunday morning.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://labnotes.org/\">Weekend Reads</a></h2>\n<p>Last but not least, the newsletter that equips me with memes for Monday. Itâ€™s a humorous mix of tweets, videos and GIFs (mostly) related to web development.</p>\n<h2>ðŸ“° Best Newsletters for Web Developers?</h2>\n<p>What are your best newsletters? Let me know <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jarednielsen\">@jarednielsen</a></p>\n<p><em>Producing and publishing a professional newsletter is a time-consuming process requiring careful consideration of both content and layout.
