Itâ€™s all here.</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¨ <a href=\"https://hackernewsletter.com/\">Hacker Newsletter</a></p>\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n<p><em>TL;DR</em> is a daily dose of tech news curated for web developers.

Itâ€™s also</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¨ <a href=\"https://ponyfoo.com/weekly\">Pony Foo Weekly</a></p>\n<h2>JavaScript Weekly</h2>\n<p>In addition to updates on the rapidly evolving JavaScript ecosystem, this newsletter is loaded with tutorials for every skill level as well as links to new and interesting projects. And if you want to really nerd out, you can sign up for its sister publications, <a href=\"https://nodeweekly.com/\">Node Weekly</a> and <a href=\"https://react.statuscode.com/\">React Status</a>, but note that the most important stories bubble up to <em>JavaScript Weekly</em>.</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¨ <a href=\"https://javascriptweekly.com/\">JavaScript Weekly</a></p>\n<h2>Python Weekly</h2>\n<p>If youâ€™re a JS developer looking for a second language to learn, might I suggest Python? This newsletter is consistently good and if youâ€™re interested in machine learning, youâ€™ll find great resources for all levels.</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¨ <a href=\"https://www.pythonweekly.com/\">Python Weekly</a></p>\n<h2>Pointer</h2>\n<p><em>Pointer</em> tends to address concerns related to management, both inter- and intra- personal. There is something perspective-changing in every issue, no matter where you are in your career trajectory as a web developer.</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¨ <a href=\"http://www.pointer.io/\">Pointer</a></p>\n<h2>History of the Web</h2>\n<p>There is no urgency in reading this newsletter as it is all old news, but it is definitely in the need-to-know category. Each issue is a deep-dive into a â€˜forgottenâ€™ history of the web. The issues are always fascinating and always informative.</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¨ <a href=\"https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/\">History of the Web</a></p>\n<h2>Mozilla Developer Newsletter</h2>\n<p>The <em>MDN</em> newsletter rounds out those listed above with links to resources for noobs and pros on accessibility, privacy, performance and beyond. Bonus: weekly developer tools tips (but for Firefox, naturally).</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¨ <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/newsletter/developer/\">Mozilla Developer Newsletter</a></p>\n<h2>Programming Digest</h2>\n<p>This understated missive is excellent in its lean curation of high-level, language-agnostic articles on its stated topic. One of my favorite weekend reads, I look forward to its arrival every Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¨ <a href=\"https://programmingdigest.net/\">Programming Digest</a></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://labnotes.org/\">Weekend Reads</a></h2>\n<p>Last but not least, the newsletter that equips me with memes for Monday. Itâ€™s a humorous mix of tweets, videos and GIFs (mostly) related to web development.</p>\n<p>ðŸ“¨</p>\n<h2>ðŸ“° Best Newsletters for Web Developers?</h2>\n<p>What are your best newsletters?
